# Suggestions

Ideas for data suggestions that could be generated programmatically when data is refreshed from various sources.


## Dataset ideas

 * completeness statistics, comparing land transactions and OpenStreetMap
 * streets mentioned in land transactions but not in OpenStreetMap (and vice versa)
 * streets in OpenStreetMap with no postcode but match a street in gov.im dataset with a postcode
 * streets that have numbered properties, but don't have any addresses in OpenStreetMap yet
 * postcode sectors (plus alpha) that are missing from OpenStreetMap still
 * new companies / business names
 * large planning applications that are likely to require map updates

## Process ideas

 * Markdown pages with suggestions
 * link to iD editor/Level0 editor with suggestions prefilled
 * create datasets to import into MapRoulette
