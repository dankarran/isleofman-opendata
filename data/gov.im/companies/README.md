## Datasets

  * Old company names index :spiral_notepad: [CSV](https://github.com/dankarran/isleofman-opendata/blob/main/data/gov.im/companies/outputs/old-names.csv)

## Open data provider

  * [Isle of Man Government](https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/government/open-data/)
    * [Companies Registry](https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/departments/enterprise/central-registry/companies-registry/)

## Known issues

  * *Incomplete data* - there isn't a consolidated published list, so the list here is based on searching using common terms and combining them. Some companies may fall through the net.

## Data retrieval

The companies index is built up by searching for common terms in the Companies Registry which should cover the majority of company names.

Current search terms:
  * *L* (includes Ltd, Limited, LLC, PLC, LP, etc.)
  * *INC*
  * *FOUNDATION*
  * *PARTNER*
  * *CORP*

TODO:
  * consider most effective and efficient way of covering company names that aren't captured (e.g. vowels, numbers, all letters)
