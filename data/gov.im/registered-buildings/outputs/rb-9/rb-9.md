Registry Entry Summary – Rose Cottage 
 
Details 
Name: Rose Cottage 
Address: Surby Road, Surby, Port Erin IM9 6TD 
Register Entry Number: 9 
Date of Registration: 23.5.1983 
 
History 
The exact date of the cottage is not clear, although it is in place at the time of the first edition 
Ordnance Survey map from the 1860s. The form and style of the historic elements suggest that it is 
likely to date from the early 19th century at least, and possibly from the 18th century. 
 
Investigation works undertaken prior to the recent extension works in the mid-2000s appeared to 
provide evidence that the western chimney stack is not of the same age as the eastern stack. A 
window opening in the western side of the cottage showed evidence of once being wider and lower 
than is currently the case, and this has led to a theory that the cottage may have been a Cow Byre. 
The first edition Ordnance Map may support this theory, as it shows a building that may have been a 
cottage to the left and in front of the current front door. It is possible that the range and chimney on 
what appears to be the historic western gable date from a point when the Byre was converted to a 
dwelling. 
 
Form and Materials 
The historic portion of the dwelling is a two cell cottage with a ‘cock loft’ over the right (eastern) 
portion. A door in the western gable gives access to a bathroom contained within a former store, 
and a corridor through to a lounge and en-suite bedroom housed within a modern extension. 
 
The historic walls are constructed of local stone (slate), with lime washed walls. Historic timber roof 
structure has been replaced. The roof is thatched, although not in the traditional style as the thatch 
is sharply cut and no ropes (or suggane) in use over the roof material. The stone pegs (bwoid 
suggane) are still in evidence on the external walls. Doors and windows are timber, the floor is stone 
flagged.
