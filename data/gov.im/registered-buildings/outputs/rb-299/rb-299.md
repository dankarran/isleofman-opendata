Register entry description 
History 
The building dates from 1789, and was built by Captain George Quayle, son of John Quayle, 
Clerk of the Rolls. The building was constructed as a boathouse, dock and stable block; 
ancillary accommodation for the Bridge House and Bridge Court complex. The site housed the 
pleasure craft Peggy, a unique vessel dating from the late 18th century. 
The site was bequeathed to the Manx nation in 1935, and opened as a museum in 1950. It 
remains in this use to the present day. 
Details 
MATERIALS: Locally sourced Limestone, with a stone floor to the boathouse and dock. Upper 
floors and roof structure formed of timber. Roofs finished in slate tiles. Parts of the south 
eastern wall are clad in slate, while the south-western (harbour) wall has received a concrete 
finish.  

 
PLAN: Two storeys, additionally with an attic in the section facing Bridge Street. Essentially L-
shaped, the lower level contains a boathouse and dock, with a shed alongside and a stable 
block in a wing along the harbour wall. The upper level contains a cabin room over the 
boathouse, a void over the dock, an exhibition space over the shed below, and the upper level 
of the stable block. A courtyard fills the area between the museum buildings and Bridge 
Court/Bridge House. 
 
EXTERIOR: Horizontally laid local Limestone, with parts of the building clad in hanging slates. 
The building’s south-western wall forms the harbour wall, and this has received a concrete 
finish. Parts of the courtyard facing walls have elements of brickwork. The Bridge Street 
elevation features recently installed timber doors in a traditional style, with glazed screening 
behind. Roofs are finished in natural slate laid in diminishing courses. Windows are single 
glazed timber sliding sash units, generally with Georgian bars in a six over six pattern. 
 
INTERIOR: The boathouse has a stone cobbled floor, although the slipway section has been 
temporarily filled with gravel to bring the level up to that of the adjacent floor. On the upper 
level, the cabin room is timber panelled, with a historic fireplace and various hidden storage 
spaces and access panels. The Bridge Street facing section, currently the public entrance/exit, 
has an attic space with exposed A-frame timber roof structure. 
 
Subsidiary Features: The private dock within the site is formed of stone, and features a low 
level arched access to the outer harbour area, over which is a walkway/viewing platform.
