  - As a shallow-curved viaduct constructed in local stone and Ruabon brick, the building is a nationally important example of its type and retains much of its historic fabric, detailing and craftsmanship.
  - Constructed by Mark Carine to a design attributed to William Knowles, the viaduct echoes the arch design of the adjacent Moore’s Bridge. This historic unity provides the two structures with a strong group value.

Register Entry Summary – Manx Electric Railway Viaduct, Laxey
Details 
Name: Manx Electric Railway Viaduct, Laxey 
Location: South of Laxey Station, over Church Hill, Mill Road and the Glenroy River 
Register Entry Number: 343 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025
History 
The construction of the bridge began in March 1898, and was completed during July 1898. Viaduct 
design is attributed to William Knowles. Douglas-based builder Mark Carine was responsible for the 
construction. 
Prior to construction of the bridge, the electric railway (in 1894 The Douglas and Laxey Coast Electric 
Tramway Company owned by the Isle of Man Tramway & Electric Power Company, and from 1902 
the Manx Electric Railway) terminated below the Queen’s Hotel near Rencell Hill. From July 1895 the 
line terminated close to the southern end of the road bridge (Moore’s Bridge). The viaduct was 
constructed as part of the tramway’s extension to Ballure on the outskirts of Ramsey. The whole 
extension to Ballure opened on 2nd August 1898, following a satisfactory inspection from the 
inspector of railways (Colonel Rich) on 18th July 1898. The structure continues to serve its original 
purpose over 125 years after its construction. 
The Church Hill Road bridge section was replaced in 2010, installing a reinforced concrete deck 
edged with a galvanised steel channel. This work included the deconstruction of the sections of 
parapet wall above the deck and their reconstruction once the replacement deck was in place. 
Details 
MATERIALS: Manx Group stone (known locally as Manx Slate) used for the majority of the viaduct, 
with Ruabon brickwork arches, soldier courses and lozenge-shaped capping to parapet. Steel girder 
beams support the deck over Church Hill. 
FORM: Shallow-curved in plan form, four symmetrical semi-circular arches over the Glenroy valley 
with an additional steel girder supported opening carrying the deck over Church Hill on the northern 
side of the valley. Four-brick high recessed soldier course runs the length of the viaduct above the 
arches. Parapet walls extend above the tramway deck on both sides with a crenelated form capped 
with Ruabon brick in a lozenge shape. Pyramid-capped pillars finish the parapet walls at each end. 
Arches are formed in brickwork, copying the adjacent road bridge in their form. A buttress formed in 
stone projects from the eastern wall adjacent to the southern-most arch.
