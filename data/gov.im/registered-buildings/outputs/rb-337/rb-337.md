Register Entry Summary – Laxey Glen Flour Mills 
 
Details 
Name: Laxey Glen Flour Mills 
Address: Mill Road, Laxey, IM4 7AU 
Register Entry Number: 337 
Date of Registration: 28.2.2024 
 
History 
In the 1850s Richard Rowe, Captain of the Laxey Mines, sought to open a much larger mill in Laxey to 
provide flour and bread for the miners and their families. At its peak, the Laxey mine was one of the 
busiest in the British Isles and had over 600 people employed. The mill was designed by Robert 
Casement (the Mines Superintendent Engineer and designer of the Lady Isabella Water Wheel), and 
is believed to have been built by John James Moore (builder of Moore’s Bridge over Glen Roy). It was 
officially opened on 27th February 1861. 
The mill has survived 3 reported fires during its history. In 1873 the first fire took place in the 
plantation behind the mill and did not harm the buildings themselves. The second occurred in 
January 1921 and it gutted the main mill building, although the adjacent screen house survived 
relatively intact. The decision to rebuild was immediate and the mill opened again in 1924. In May 
1946 the third fire again damaged the roof and plant of the mill building itself but it reopened within 
a month. 
 
As of February 2024, the complex is still in use as a flour mill. The site has been altered and adapted 
on numerous occasions since 1861, and retains many elements that help illustrate its history over 
more than 160 years. 
 
Form and Materials 
This registration includes:  
• 
Main mill building 
• 
Screen House 
• 
Cistern 
• 
Water Lade (Mill Race) 
• 
Subterranean Drainage Tunnels under mill buildings and yard 
 
MATERIALS: Walls are horizontally coursed Manx stone (slate). Pitched roofs to main building and 
adjacent screen house are welsh slate. Steel beams provide structural support. Windows are single 
glazed timber framed units on the east facing principal elevation. Window arches and reveals are 
constructed in brickwork. Roof lights are metal framed. The cistern and water lade (mill race) are 
constructed of the same horizontally coursed Manx stone (slate) as the mill buildings.  
Although information is limited at the time of writing this summary, video images suggest that the 
network of subterranean drainage tunnels are also constructed of Manx stone (slate), with a semi-
circular arched ceiling constructed in the same material. 

PLAN: Four storey principal mill building is rectangular on plan. There is a vehicular access way in the 
northern end of the building at ground floor level. The Screen House immediately south of the main 
building is approximately square in plan, four storeys high. The top two storeys of the Screen House 
were added in 1910. The cistern is cylindrical in shape, with walls featuring shallow pilasters linked 
by semi-circular arches in a similar style to those on the main building and screen house. The lade 
(mill race) is formed of a linear stone channel and side walls running from the cistern in a westerly 
direction for approximately 600 metres to join the Glenroy River.  
EXTERIOR: Main building’s principal (east facing) elevation consists of nine bays, four storeys high. 
Each bay is divided by full height shallow pilaster columns with a connecting arch detail over each 
fourth storey opening. When constructed in 1860-61, the main building comprised of seven bays – 
the northern two bays being added later. The central bay (of the initial seven) at fourth floor level 
has a clock in place of the window, above which at eaves level is a large feature moulding pediment 
upstand reading ‘Laxey Glen Mills’ and the date of 1860. The building has a hipped pitched roof for 
the most part, with a flat roof over the most northerly two bays of the building. When first built, the 
seven bay main building had a roof formed of two unequally sized pitched hipped roofs, with a roof 
valley running north-south between the two (see image 6). The windows on the main building 
feature two intermediate mullions throughout and a single transom a third of the way from the 
arched window head at ground, first and second floor levels. Alternate windows at ground, first and 
second floors have top-opening casements. Some UPVC units in evidence on secondary elevations. 
The Screen House has three bays and is generally constructed in the same style as the main building, 
with exposed stone walls and a hipped pitched roof.  
INTERIOR: Fire is known to have gutted the main mill building in 1921, and a further fire in 1946 is 
known to have damaged the roof and plant in the main building. The adjacent screen house is 
believed to have suffered less fire damage than the main building, and is open plan. Internally the 
main building is generally also open plan, with a single dividing wall running north south at all levels. 
This wall initially supported the internal facing pitches of the roofs above. All of the floors of the 
main building and screen house contain various items of plant machinery associated with the milling 
process; much of which is on a scale not replicated elsewhere on the Isle of Man. This machinery 
varies in age, but generally dates from the mid-20th century onwards.
