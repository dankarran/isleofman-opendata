MAY BILL HOUSE, RAMSEY
Historical Notes
Introduction
May Hill House (formerly Cronk Brae) is situated in Ramsey, separated from
Summerland by Queen’s Pier Road, It provides impressive views of Ramsey and is a
landmark on the TT Course.
May Hill House was built on land sold by the Reverend William Kermode between
the 1850’s and 1870’s. This area of south Ramsey is noted for its remarkable land and
sea views. May Hill House was built prior to the time in the 19" century when
Ramsey was undergoing considerable expansion, the town was expanding away from
the harbour and into the surrounding quarterlands, specifically to the south and the
west. With the development of houses, roads and shops, along with the construction
of the Queen’s Pier Road, the Mooragh Park, the Queen’s Pier Road and the
development of the Mountain Road in the 1880’s, Ramsey was attracting a
considerable number of people and its population was increasing steadily.
In 1865 Ramsey was constituted a town and by 1871, with a population of 3,934, it
was the second largest town next to Douglas. At this time Ramsey was in competition
with Douglas, as they were both fishing ports situated close to England. Further
expansion was anticipated, but in reality no further developments happened until the
1960's,

Architectural and Historical Interest
‘The Reverend Wilham Kermode bought the land along Summerland, including the
land on which May Hill House now stands in December 1859. The Reverend who
was the chaplain of
St Paul’s’, (1843-1871) had a great love of buildings and saw his
land as being an integral part of the expansion of Ramsey at the time. He was
occupied with the future health, prosperity and progress of the town and in 1840 he
was involved im the formation of the Ramsey Health Association. The Reverend
Kermode divided up the land, and the section of land on which May Hill House stands
was sold in October 1866 to John Corlett LaMothe. The deed included restrictions on
the layout and style of any proposed buildings, the Reverend had to over see any
building plans and no trade or business was to take place without the Reverend’s
permission. A penalty was to be incurred if the contract was broken, The Reverend
felt strongly that the buildings built on the land should be of similar style.
May Hill House was built between December 1866 and 1869, when it first appears on
a survey of land In 1969 John Corlett LaM@che bought two additional plots of land
from the Reverend Kermode, which were alongside and in front of May Hill House.
Today the land belonging to May Hill House has changed since 1870-1898, with more
land at the rear than was recorded at that time. The Queen’s Pier Road was built
through the grounds of the house in the 1880's.
May Hill House is said to be the most architecturally superior of the houses in the
area, built on land which once belonged to the Reverend, which also includes The Old
Vicarage, Hillside houses and the nearby Summerland houses. The Summerland

houses are all similar while the others vary externally, while being in-keeping with the
Reverend’s wishes of similarity of deign. It has been suggested that these houses had
been built for people who were prominent in Victorian Ramsey.
May Hill House was built in a modern gothic style, with steep pitches and a tower.
Internally, the cornicing and skirting are similar to the Old Vicarage, Hillside House
and Summerland, while the joinery is different. The theme of the decoration is
consistent throughout the house, with the decoration at its most grand on the ground
floor, and the level decreasing with each floor of the house.
Features of interest throughout the house include the main stair newel which appears
to be a direct copy of a newel illustrated in ‘The Elements of Style’, taken from a
book of 1860, ‘Cottage, Lodge and Villa Architecture’, by G A and W J Audsley. The
door cases are similar to those found in the Ramsey Methodist Church, dating from
1845. The wall at the back of the house, first recorded in the 1870 Ordnance Survey
Map shows the extent of the garden. The wall is high with a centre archway,
providing access to the servant’s quarters. This wall is similar to the wall surrounding
Dunlace, another Gothic-style Victorian house, found on Ballure Road, Ramsey.
John Corlett LaMoche and his family lived at May Hill House between the Census
returns of 1871 (when the house was known as Sandy Mount) and 1881 (when it was
known as Cronk Brae). LaMoche was an important character in Ramsey, being an
advocate and high bailiff. James Cruikshank and his family were resident at the house
during the time of the 1891 census. Another person notable in the history of Ramsey,
we

Cruikshank spent time as the Chairman of Ramsey Town Commissioners and was
involved in the building of the Ramsey and District Cottage Hospital.

‘a group of houses which represent an important time in the 19" century
