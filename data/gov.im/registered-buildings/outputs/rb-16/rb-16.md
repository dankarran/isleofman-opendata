5? Lge Steoot
The four storey cectangular building backs onto the estuary at the
entrance to Castletown harboureThe pitchec slate roof is masked by
3 parapet wall extension of the main walls.To the front on Bridge
Street the facade is cement renuered as is the north gable.The other
two walls however are faced with vertically hurg slates.All of the
window openings in the building are rectangular with the vertical
dimension being slightly larger on the middle two floors than the
upper and lower floors. The main entrance is marked by a small colunned
porch direct onto the limited pavement.The is a rectangular three
storey oxtension on the southern wall.
No interior examination has been carried out.
The building does not appear to be in a good state of repair.
recommendation
The building would not seem to have any merit other than through its
is ussociations with former owners and their activities such
as smuggling. Although such associations have interest it is not felt
to be sufficient to warrant listing this buildiag for preservation
unless such listings are to become widespread throughout the island,
