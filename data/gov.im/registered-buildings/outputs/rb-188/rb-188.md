All Saints, Anglican Church
Douglas
Siting
The church occupies the site of the old church, with it’s east end abutting Selbourne
Road and facing the Church Hall, the west end facing Primrose Avenue and the north
side running parallel with Alexander Drive.
Historical Notes
Greeba Towers was offered by Mr. Quayle Farrant and his sister as a potential site for
the new church at a meeting held on 2TM, November 1896, with the Bishop,
Archdeacon, Vicar Baron and several local residents. The handing over of the
freehold could not take place which meant that the land would have to be held in
lease, preventing the opening and the licensing of a temporary church.
Deemster Gill passed a resolution at the 1897 Diocesan Conference in Douglas,
presided over by Bishop Stratton that another church was needed in Upper Douglas.
The Revd J. B. George, while Vicar of St. George’s, had collected money for a church
in this part of the parish. In Bishop Hill’s time Vicar Savage of St. Thomas’s was
willing to erect a chapel of ease to St. Thomas’ in the Murray Road area but the plan
fell through because Hill insisted on the new building being given a separate parish.
Vicar Baron became ultimately responsible for the building of All Saints as a daughter
church in the parish, he died suddenly on the 4". November 1906, aged 59 and was
buried in the churchyard of St George’s.
The foundation stone laying ceremony took place on the 8". February 1898. The
Bishop preached at the opening and licensing of the Church on the 14". July 1898.
The church seating 500, served the upper part of Douglas as a Curacy of St. George’s.
The building was designed in the decorative style of the 14". Century and was built of
iron by Mr. J. B. Hawes, an iron building manufacturer of Deptford, London. The
church became known locally as the ‘Tin Tabernacle’, due to it’s method of
construction. The building, being built of iron was always intended as a temporary
measure, which far outlasted it’s expected lifespan. As far back as 1938, the state of
the building had become such that a decision had to be made between abandoning the
Church completely or rebuilding. In 1965 it was finally demolished to make way for
the fine modern church consecrated in 1967 and now attached to St. Thomas’s.
Description of All Saints’ Church
The main entrance is from Alexander Drive by way of a porch at the west end on the
north side. A bell tower rises from this porch, up to about 50 feet.
Rectangular in shape with seating accommodation for 350, the church is 108 feet long
and 40 feet wide.

The Nave, Chancel and Sanctuary maintain a constant width from end to end, the
centre aisle is 8 feet wide and the south aisle 6 feet wide.
The organ is positioned on the south side of the Chancel.
The external walls of the Chancel and Sanctuary are in Manx stone, contrasting with
the remainder of the Church which is finished in White Irish Limestone.
At the west end of the Church are the vestries for the Clergy and the Choir all giving
common access to the Nave.
The structural frame in this Church is a development used for the first time in the Isle
of Man. It has been used in German churches in tubular form, but here in All Saints’
it consists of 132 inch by 8 inch rolled hollow steel sections welded at the joints,
giving an overall impression of simplicity, lightness and elegance, combined with
strength, of which uncovered steel is capable.
An innovation in the form of the roof was incorporated, by covering the rolled steel
purlins with 1.5 inch thick “Wayroc’ man-made timber which with the steel purlins,
introduces an interesting coffered, or panelled exposed ceiling. By the use of the
materials, the Architect had eliminated the need for the roof rafters 10 support the roof
tiles.
The building of the church was carried out by Messrs. Parkinson Limited of Braddan,
and the result is a superb example of the Manx Stonemason’s craft at it’s best. The
Choir Stalls and pews were constructed by Kelly Bros. of Kirk Michael.
Most of the internal woodwork is made of Agba African Hardwood, excepting the
Choir Stalls and the west end wall panelling which is of American Walnut. The
external doors and woodwork are of Iroko hardwood.
Of special interest is the effective use of modern reinforced white concrete, as in the
four sides of 'the Camponile’ , and in the flanking screens which assist in supporting
the unusual shaped canopy over the main entrance doors.
In contrast, the large west window incorporating Memorial windows to the Royal Air
Force Association and Seamen’s Association in the Island, is constructed of in situ
white concrete, with a reinforced concrete arched beam at the head to support the
weight of the west wall above, and the roof.
The design of the Memorial windows is deep and shaded, sand blasted on polished
plate glass, with a background in acid stippled obscure glass, which is a moder
technique for etching the design on glass, and this method has also been used for the
glass panels forming the sides of the hardwood combined Lectern and Pulpit. So far
as is known, this was the first Pulpit to be formed partly of glass.
The large south window 1o the sanctuary is constructed of small pre-cast and
reinforced white concrete sections doweled together to form a magnificent window
which casts south light on the Altar and Sanctuary.

The windows lighting the Nave are glazed with tinted glass, blue in colour while the
south Sanctuary window glass is pink.
Two unique features are the red glass Cruciform window over the Altar (now floodlit
from the interior to enable the cross to be seen from Selbourne Road when evenings
are dark), and the twelve different coloured Apostle windows lighting the Chancel on
the north side.
The heating too was the first installation of it’s type on the Island, and is a forced
warm air system, oil fired, and operating by warm air being forced through two high
level grills adjacent to the heating chamber. The system obviates the need for any
pipe work or radiators, as the cooler air is withdrawn through a return air grill in the
floor near the chamber, where it is reheated.
The east wall is clad with riven stone, quarried at Pooilvaaish by Manx Marble and
Granite Company, and provides the maximum contrast with the rough white plaster
Reredos panel.
The Altar table is made of red-pink Francia marble, from Carrara, Italy, and was
partly executed in Italy and finished in the Isle of Man. This magnificent table was
donated, along with various other items in the building.
The Font is constructed of grey-green Irish Limestone, imported from Northern
Ireland, and having an Agba hardwood font cover with bezelled copper edges, to tone
with the pews and the main light fittings. The design on the font was sandblasted into
the quarried stone and the pattern used is a ring chain of Gaut, first developed by
Norse Sculptor, Gaut Bjornson, who originated this particular form of art, and thus a
link has been provided with the culture of the early Christian era in the Island.
The Organ screen is formed with 1 inch square rolled hollow steel, and the decoration
on the screen consists of star motifs made of cast aluminium, both anodised and
colour enamelled.
The Church Bell weighs 6.5 cwt., and was made in the foundry of Messrs. John
Taylor, Loughborough, Leicestershire, one of the oldest bell founders in Britain. It is
operated electrically to the note of D, by the touch of a switch at the foot of the
Campanile, and the interval between each toll can be varied as required.
The lighting and the fittings themselves consist of cluster lights, the main fittings
having copper polished tops. At the west end diffused pelmet lighting casts a soft
glow on the walnut panelling, whilst flood and spot lights have been used in the Choir
stalls to avoid interruption of the view to the Altar from the Nave seats.
The wall behind the Font is covered with a mural portraying the Nativity of our Lord,
and depicts the homage paid by the Three Kings from the East. This mural is the
work. of the late Dorothy Nicholson, the well-known local artist, and wife of the late
John Nicholson, R.L, who acted as Colour Consultant to the Architect throughout the
project.

The Sanctuary floor consists of jade Amtico tiles covered with a carpet presented by
the Royal Air Force Association (.0.M.) Branch.
Since 1898, in the former church building, the organ music had been provided by a
small, two manual instrument, built and installed by a local firm Messrs. Pollard &
Co. This instrument was typical of the late Victorian era in tonal design.
In 1964 the question arose as to what type of organ should be provided for the new
building. It was decided that the materials and workmanship of the old instrument,
particularly the pipe work, were still of good quality and they should be preserved and
form the basis of the new instrument. This was done on the modern extension system
of organ building. The present organ is much more flexible, has more tonal reserves,
and all the actions are electric.
The area on the North side, abutting Alexander Drive, has been landscaped as a paved
Court of white and grey concrete tiles, surrounded by a low wall of local stone with
white copings, and in the centre of the paved area there is a rose bed with white
surround.
The original foundation stone taken from the old Church during the demolition has
been perpetuated by including it in the paved court.
The new All Saints’ Church was the first Anglican Church to be erected in the Island
for over fifty years.

All Saints’ Church, Douglas, is judged worthy of entry into the Protected
Buildings Register on the following grounds:-
HISTORIC CONTEXT- In the context of the Isle of Man as a separate
entity, the church deserves special consideration in that it is an

UNIQUENESS - All Saints’ Church was the first Anglican church to be
built in the Island for over Fifty years and therefore, the first church to be
built in a ‘modern’ style.
INNOVATION - Mr. C. J. Kneen the Architect, utilised many new and
revolutionary construction techniques during the erection of All Saints’
Church, namely:
The structural frame used previously in German churches in tubular
form, was a development used for the first time in the Isle of Man.
The church has an unusual roof construction, by the innovative use of the
materials, the Architect had eliminated the need for the roof rafters to
support the roof tiles.
The heating was the first installation of it’s type on the Island, an oil fired
a forced warm air system.
ARCHITECTURAL DETAILING -There is a mural by the late Dorothy
Nicholson, the well-known local artist, and wife of the late John
