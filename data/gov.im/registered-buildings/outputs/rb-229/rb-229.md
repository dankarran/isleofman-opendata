THE LODGE, BRADDAN ROAD also known as BRADDAN SCHOOLHOUSE
REPORT UPON THE MERITS OF THE ABOVE BUILDING RELATIVE TO
ITS POTENTIAL FOR ENTRY INTO THE PROTECTED BUILDINGS
REGISTER
1. BACKGROUND
The property has at some time in the past, been proposed for registration and is
identified as such in the Braddan Area Plan.
It came to the notice of the Department that the building was under threat of
demolition and in the circumstances, it was judged appropriate to serve a Building
Preservation Notice in accordance with Section 10 of the Town and Country Planning
Act 1991. This Notice, dated the 9" J anuary 2004, was served on various patties in
accordance with the terms of the Act.
A limited amount of research has been carried out in order to assess whether or not
the building is of special architectural and historic interest, such as would merit its
entry into the Protected Buildings Register: such information is set out below.
2. BRIEF SUMMARY OF EDUCATION IN THE ISLE OF MAN TO 1851
e Prior to 1660 education on the Island mostly was provided in a non-formal
manner by the Clergy, although there seem to have been various private schools
operated by non-licensed masters.
® c.1660 saw the introduction by Bishop Barrow, of some formal requirement for
instruction and attendance.
® c.1700 Bishop Wilson developed Bishop Barrow’s scheme further, with poorly
paid masters and schools provided in each parish and town.

3. BRADDAN SCHOOL
Early mention of a school in Braddan is made in 1685 when the Convocation
distributed sums of money to the Clergy, acceptance of which made them responsible
to keep a school in their parish — including Kirk Braddan. (Ronald S Ely - Manx
Schools Past, Present and Proposed. p.7)
In his publication — An Island That Led — The History of Manx Education - Hinton
Bird makes mention of Braddan School/s in the following references:-
VOLT
® P.87 Braddan seemed to be the sole parish to have a teacher unable to speak the
(Manx?) language.
@ P,96 It seems probable that by 1800 only Braddan, which was provided with a
school at Ballakinnish by Thos. Cain near the Cooil in 1815, still lacked a
purpose-built school for its children, the original of Bishop Wilson’s time, having
been allowed to decay early in its life.
e P,.232 salaries of School Masters varied ~ Jurby, Bride, Braddan & Malew - £5 per
year; lonan Patrick & andreas - £4-£5 per year. Others some as high as £7.13.6d.
© P,239 In 1833 Rev Robert Brown at Braddan claimed 2 Parochial Schools, which
probably included one at East Baldwin as the second.
VOL II
e P.37 In 1870’s only Lonan & Braddan remained outside the control of the local
School committee.
4, DRAWINGS
Of crucial importance is the existence of a set of original drawings held in the archive
at the Manx Museum, and which depict: ‘The Proposed School Buildings, Kirk
Braddan Isle of Man’ and ‘The Proposed Master's Residence, Kirk Braddan, Isle of
Man’. There is also a ‘Plan of Site’ for the project.

heavy, timber doors with strap hinges were common to both. Ballamona Hospital was
opened in 1868, and so to find Joseph working in the immediate area within ten years
of completion of this major work, designing the proposed school and school house, is
not entirely surprising. Being well acquainted with the design and detail of the
Ballamona Hospital, prior to its demolition, I can detect a similar confidence of
design approach in the 1858 drawings, resulting a building of distinction in Island
terms. It would appear that the body which commissioned the design and construction
of the buildings, in choosing Joseph Christian, desired that the standard and quality of
the proposed school and school house, should be the best available at that time.
6 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
It is evident from the information obtained regarding the School and the School
Master’s House (now known as The Lodge) that in their original form the pair
constituted a striking composition being designed by the eminent Architect, Joseph
Henry Christian.
It is regrettable that the School has been enveloped by additions and extensions
carried out during the twentieth century, such that the quality and form of this
building is no longer discernible, at least from the exterior. It is also regrettable that
the rich red brick finish which was a feature of the buildings has been rendered in
Portland Cement. The decorative chimney stacks still provide a notable feature in the
School Master’s House, giving us a glimpse of the quality of the building in its
original state. However the form of the School Master’s House is largely in tact. It
may be that with the passage of time and weathering, the render may be possible to
remove without undue damage thus allowing the brickwork to be re-pointed and
reinstated to its former glory.
The Braddan Cemetry Office, designed by internationally acclaimed architect,
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott and built in 1892 within a stone’s throw of the school and
house, also appears to be almost a junior member of this small architectural family.
The Cemetry Office is the first known of the young Baillie Scott’s work after coming
to the Island and what better subjects might he find to study, than Christian’s School
and School Master’s House, in addition to the more imposing BallamonaHospital, just
along the road. The Braddan Cemetry Office also makes use of leaded lights, red
