35/37 ATHOL STREET DOUGLAS
When the partnership of Harris & Adams, one of the earliest law firms
on the Island, was dissolved in 1862, A W Adams commenced practice
alone. In the same year he purchased 37 Athol Street for £210 from
Messrs Caley and Gelling, Joiners and Builders, who had been using
it as their yard. It had originally contained stabling for another house
in Athol Street. To this day, the building remains the only purpose-
built advocate’s office on the Island.
In 1869, Mr Adams took into partnership a newly qualified advocate
called W F Dickinson. The partnership was known as Adams &
Dickinson until the retirement of Mr Adams. Thomas Kneen replaced
him in 1879 when the firm’s title became Dickinson & Kneen. On Mr
Kneen’s appointment as Deemster in 1899, Mr Dickinson took as his
new partner James Murray Cruckshank and the name of Dickinson,
Cruckshank & Co, that remains today, came into being. In 1921, Mr
Dickinson sold 37 Athol Street to the partners J W Hyde and Edwyn
Kneen.
In 1935, the firm acquired the adjacent property, 35 Athol Street, for
£1,100 to facilitate expansion. This property had been built as a
house during the mid 1830s. Athol Street was originally developed as
houses or shops with living accommodation. Offices: were first
established when the Courthouse moved there in 1869.
Number 35 was in office use by 1886, when Mary Sagor sold the
property to John Hardy. Hardy in turn sold it the following year to
Henry Bean. Norwich Union purchased it in 1924 from Bean’s
descendants, and they continued to occupy the ground floor for many
years after the sale to Dickinson, Cruckshank & Co.
Today, the facade consists of four windows at first floor level with
surrounding mouldings, set beneath an elaborate pediment. Below
them at ground floor level is a pair of sash windows with a door to the
left, this was the main entrance to the offices until 1982.
Originally this facade was symmetrical with a second entrance door to
the ground floor front room. Today there is no evidence of this
doorway other than disfigurement of the cement render, but the gate
in the Victorian railing remains. There is a metal shutter to the front
window, thought to have been installed when the premises were used
as temporary accommodation for the Bank of Mona.
The front office was traditionally used by the senior partner, with the
remainder of the ground floor being a single room used by clerks and
other staff. The two first floor rooms, with high coffered ceilings, were
originally let separately.

The very plain south west elevation was not intended to be seen, but it
was exposed when number 39 Athol Street was demolished to provide
an access of increased width from Athol Street to Shaw’s Brow.
Following the demolition of number 39, plans were approved in June
1960, on behalf of Mr E W Fargher, to insert windows into this gable
wall. At that time the front elevation still had two doorways.
Interestingly, in this application the property was described as 39
Athol Street.
Number 35 consists of basement, ground and three upper floors. The
ground floor front elevation has three sash windows, the right-hand
one was inserted in 1970 to replace the original entrance doorway.
The combined property of 35/37 Athol Street has therefore seen a
reduction from three doorways to just one, and even this is disused.
The toilet extension to the rear of 35 Athol Street was built in 1936,
but the majority of internal alterations and rear extensions have taken
place since the mid 1960s.
In 1982, on completion of a new office building adjacent to 35 Athol
Street, which replaced Manningtons’ Bottling Plant, connections were
made at ground and second floor levels. Access to 35/37 Athol Street
is today gained through the new building.
The property has an unusual sprinkler system consisting of many
exposed pipes, this was manufactured by Mather and Platt and
installed in the late 1930s.
Whilst there have been internal changes to make the combined
premises a suitable home for a modern-day legal practice, many
original features do remain. In number 37, these include a fine-fitted
bookcase in the ground floor front office; moulded cornice to the office
above, and a cast iron door to the basement strong room. Even
though the remaining entrance door is now unused, the inner porch
way /lobby remains original.
In number 35 Athol Street, the staircase may well be original and in
both properties there are numerous items of internal joinery which
have remained unaltered since the properties were built.
The properties are probably constructed in random stone, with the
exception of the later rear additions that are more likely to be brick or
block. Where visible, the roof is noted to be of slate, other than the
flat-roofed extension to number 35,

All external wall surfaces are cement rendered. The side and rear
elevations are in a smooth, undecorated finish and these have mainly
uPVC windows.
The front elevations of numbers 35 and 37 have been integrated, and
feature chamfered rustification to the render below the moulded string
course, with smooth cement render above. There are timber sliding
sash windows to the combined front elevation, with the exception of
the third floor on number 35 which has top opening sashes. The
railings on numbers 35 and 37 differ as they were built for different
owners some 30 years apart.
Number 35 Athol Street has lost much of its character, it is no longer
possible to access the building from Athol Street. It has rear additions
that are out of sympathy with the original building. It is desirable to
conserve the front elevation, but little else is of significant importance.
The property would be sufficiently protected by inclusion within a
conservation area, and is not considered to be of adequate merit to
justify inclusion on the Register of Protected Buildings.
Number 37 Athol Street however is unique, being the only purpose-
built advocate’s office on the Island. It retains much of its original
character although, due to the removal of the second entrance door to
Athol Street, it is no longer symmetrical. It would be possible to re-
instate this doorway if desired.
It is recommended that number 37 Athol Street, Douglas, be added to
the Register of Protected Buildings on the following grounds:
1 Uniqueness
2 Historical interest in the development of a legal practice
3 Aesthetic quality
