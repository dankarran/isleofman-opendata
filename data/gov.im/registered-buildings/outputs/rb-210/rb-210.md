4-11 HARRIS TERRACE, DOUGLAS.
History of the area
Historically, the site on which Harris Terrace was later built belonged to the
quarterland of Ballakermeen, in the treen of Douglas, within the Parish of Kirk
Conchan (now Onchan). In 1610 Ballakermeen quarterland was divided into
three large estates, Finch Hill, Hill's and Joyner’s. Joyner’s estate contained
the area of land on which Harris Terrace was later built. “/t was purchased by
Thomas Joyner and remained in the Joyner family for some five or six
generations before being inherited by Richard Joyners daughter Margaret,
who was married to Robert Heywood of the Nunnery family.” (Slack S., p.82).
Following this, the estate came into the hands of their second son, Cailcott
Heywood (MHK), who sold of most of the prime building land from the early
nineteenth century. It was around this time (1825) that Samuel Harris bought
the plot of land now containing Harris Terrace and the adjacent Ellan Vannin
Home. The land was than referred to as the ‘Brickfield’ and the boundaries of
this area are still visible on the Ordnance Survey map of Douglas dating from
1870.
Harris Terrace was built facing a section of the ancient boundary wall between
the Joyner’s and Finch Hill estates which can still be seen today. The land
belonging to number 11 Harris Terrace has an unusual triangular shape due
to the shape of the estate boundary. It is unknown how old the wail in front of
the terrace is (the quarterland was divided from as early as 1610), but the first
evidence which we have found of the existence of a wall is in a Plan and
Survey of Land near Douglas in the Parish of Onchan belonging to Calcott
Heywood Esq. dating from 1805 (a copy of this plan is included with this
report).
The remainder of the estate then passed to Rebecca, the niece of Caicott
Heywood, who married Henry Bloom Noble. In 1886 she donated the land for
the building of Noble’s Hospital (now the Manx Museum).
Samuel Harris bought the land in 1825 and in 1837 Harris Terrace and the
’ adjacent House of Industry (now the Ellan Vannin Home) were constructed on
the site of the former Brickfield, both were included in the Census of 1841. As
late as 1832, advertisements were still appearing in the local press for bricks
at two pounds per thousand (Slack S.).
The first Ordnance Survey map of Douglas dates from 1870 and it shows that
Harris Terrace was one of the first groups of houses to be built in the area.
Stuart Slack has dated the construction of some of the neighbouring terraces
in his book ‘Streets of Douglas ~ Old and New’, but none of these other
groups pre-date Harris Terrace (1837). Albert Terrace is the oldest built in
1847, then Christian Road (1854), whilst Kingswood Grove, Osborne Grove
and Richmond Grove date from the 1870's. Harris Terrace has a much
simpler design than these other terraces, indicating it is older. The Census
returns of 1841 for Harris Terrace include many heads of household as

people of independent means, a Wesleyan Minister and a boarding home
keeper. Only one head of household was Manx-born, the remainder were
from Scotland, England and treland. All but one of the properties had at least
one servant, the majority of whom were Manx born. This shows that the
inhabitants of Harris Terrace were wealthy well-to-do people, mainly new to
the island and although the terrace has a simple appearance by later Victorian
standards, in its day these were likely to have been superior residences.
Samuel Harris
It is believed that the terrace was named after Samuel Harris. In 1825
Samuel Harris senior purchased the land on which the properties were built in
1837 (Slack S., p.72). In Pigot and Slater’s Directory for 1843, Samuel Harris
junior was working as an advocate on Bond Street. Samuel Harris was one of
the most important businessmen in Victorian Douglas. He was an advocate,
a member of the Manx Bar, the government company and deeds registrar,
one of the founders of the Isle of Man Bank in 1865 and High-Bailiff for
Douglas for forty years from 1864 (Sixty Years of Banking History of The Isle
of Man Banking Co., a Manx Note Book website).
Architectural Description
The qualities of Harris Terrace are not immediately obvious. The terrace
consists of eight houses in a stepped arrangement. The properties are three
storeys high, flat fronted and rather plain.
Within the terrace, number 10 has the most original features, including the
ground floor Venetian sash (a device used to provide a window for a larger
opening without a central division) and the door case. Most of the houses still
retain the door case with a fanlight, which is the main feature of the front
elevation.
The 1870 series Ordnance Survey map shows the terrace some thirty years
after it was built. At that time access to the properties was from Finch Road,
up beside Mona Terrace and the Parsonage. The back lane also serviced the
rear of the House of Industry (the Work House), also built in 1837. The
properties had no immediate access (except by foot) to the new Bucks Road
Harris Terrace pre-dates most of the surrounding terraces. They are different
from the latter terraces because they do not have bay windows (which come
later as developers tried to make houses more individual). These houses
have very subtle status symbols whereas increasingly in the Victorian period
we see the emphasis being places on more and more elaborate ways of
dressing up the front of the houses.

Conclusion
These homes therefore have a strong sense of early Victorian Douglas and
were built at the time the House of Industry was built, on land formerly part of
the Joyner’s estate. Enough remains of this terrace that if it was maintained
and restored it would provide a key example of early housing before the
explosion of property encouraged by the development of Bucks Road. Harris
Terrace is like The Esplanade, Finch Road and Mona Terrace. These are
reminders of the early development of Douglas from a busy port to the capital
and seat of Tynwald.
