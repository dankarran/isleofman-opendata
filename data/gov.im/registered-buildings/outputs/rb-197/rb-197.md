ST. MARY’S CHURCH HILL STREET DOUGLAS
The foundation stone for St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church was laid on October 28th
1857, and the Church designed by Henry Clutton of London was opened on 4th
August 1859, the cost of construction being £7,000. The Church was given the name
St. Mary of the Isle taking this name from the rocky islet in Douglas Bay which later
became known as the Conister Rock when the Tower of Refuge had been built upon it.
St. Mary’s was built to replace St. Bridget’s Chapel near the Nunnery and St. Francis
Xavier’s on Athol Street, which were of inadequate size to accommodate their
growing congregations. Clutton designed St. Mary’s to be large enough for
congregations swelled by thousands of visitors during the summer months.
St. Mary’s reflects Clutton’s favoured continental Gothic style of the 13th century.
Construction was carried out by Messrs. G P White of Pimlico, London. There was
considerable local opposition to the new Church as its construction was seen to be
exhibiting growth of the Catholic Church on the Island, which was judged to be
influential on “weak minded people.” This opposition included mobs of several
hundreds roaming the streets of Douglas, breaking windows in the Athol Street Chapel
and at the business premises of leading Catholics. St. Mary’s is surrounded by a high
stone wall with a sandstone coping, this was provided to offer a sense of security to
those worshipping inside. There was originally a heavy solid timber folding door, but
this was replaced by iron gates designed by (Sir) Giles Gilbert Scott in 1915. This
anti-Catholic sentiment continued and in 1862 wire guards were fitted to prevent
further breakage of the window glass.
St. Mary’s is built in local stone, with string courses and carved decoration in red
sandstone imported from Whitehaven. The parapet wall at roof level around the apse
of the Church dates from the post war period, it being a replacement for its delicately
carved predecessor which had suffered from serious erosion.
The sides of the Church are very plain without buttress or projection. At 17 feet above
floor level, a band of sandstone passes around the building, sitting upon this are the tall
lancet windows, 5 to each side of the Church and 4 in the west gable. Surmounting
the windows in the gable is a large St. Catherine’s Wheel or Rose window. The roof
to the Church is clad in Welsh blue slate, which has recently been replaced together
with the gutters and fallpipes which are now in extruded aluminium.
The Church has twin towers, one being finished in a flat roof, the other with a
saddleback coping. It is presumed they were not built to Clutton’s original design of
twin “Rhenish Helm” spires due purely to cost. The taller tower houses the Church
bell which bears the inscription “Sheridan Dublin Maker 1852: Laus. Deo Virginique
Matri Maria.” The external dimensions of the church were given in 1862 as: Length
130 feet; Width 60 feet; Height to eves 40 feet, to gable point 60 feet. The towers are
17 feet square and 80 feet high. The article stated that they would stand nearly as high
again, but this was not to be.

The Presbytery was also designed by Clutton, and was constructed primarily in 1860
by Mr James Lambert of Eastfield, Douglas. He was also responsible for putting the
finishing touches to the Church once White’s had returned to the mainland.
The Presbytery was built in the same material as the Church, it also has been re-roofed
recently. Unfortunately, the Presbytery has been fitted with uPVC windows in recent
years.
A single story building, probably of 1970’s origin, serves as the Church Office and rear
entrance to the Presbytery. Whilst this building is in stone, it does have a flat roof
which is out of keeping. Adjacent to Hill Street, the boundary wall has been pierced to
allow for the construction of two single-storey, flat-roofed garages. Again these
appear out of context with the Church and Presbytery.
In 1973, the entrance steps to the Church were widened into a fan-shape to provide a
circulation area, also at the same time a wheelchair ramp was provided and handrails
were added in 1984. The Entrance Porch is of red sandstone and houses a statue
which post dates its plinth, which stood empty from construction to the 1890s.
In 1893, Messrs. Sinnott , Sinnott and Powell of Liverpool designed a single-storey
Repository extension. This lean-to building extends the full width of the Church and
includes the Confessionals which are accessed through the gable wall. The builder for
this extension was Mr R F Douglas. The gable wall above this extension now has a
smooth render finish. Adjacent to this extension is the Parish Hall which is presently
being demolished to be re-developed together with the adjacent site.
It is thought that the timber porch interior, with a single side door for winter use and
double doors for summer use, was built between 1861 and 1867.
The arcading which separates the knave from the aisles is spaced at 16 feet 6 inch
centres, with the point of the arches some 33 feet 3 inches above the floor. The
octagonal sandstone pillars measure 20 feet in height and are surmounted by Caen
stone capitals which have unfortunately been painted.
Internally, ever since construction, the Church has been subject to alteration, both by
necessity and also due to changing requirements to comply with new thinking within.
the Catholic Church. In 1888, a fund was started for what was described as the
“interior roof’. The ceiling we see today was not part of Clutton’s plan which
provided for heavy roof trusses exposed under a white plaster ceiling which followed
the line of the roof pitch, However, impressive as it was, the open roof did nothing to
keep the Church warm during the winter. Plans were prepared by Peter Paul Pugin,
but his scheme was superseded by an almost identical one prepared by the Bishop’s
architect, Mr James Sinnott of Sinnott, Sinnott and Powell. The red Swedish timber
ceiling was unveiled on 11th of August 1889.
In 1982, rot was found beneath the surface of the timber floor which was subsequently
removed and replaced by a concrete floor with a carpet finish.

At the rear of the Church, beneath the organ gallery, are a series of doors pierced in
the gable wall in 1893 to provide access to the new Confessionals. In 1972, the first
Confessional was altered by the demolition of the wall between it and the Mission
Library. The Confessional nearest to Myrtle Street was completely removed in 1974
to create the Memorial Entrance. The middle Confessional was altered in 1893 to
provide the Island’s first ‘Open Confessional’.
The Organ Gallery, which has a herringbone-patterned front, was extended in 1874 to
accommodate a new organ, this replacing the first organ which was the 1839 organ
from St. Francis Xavier’s. The current organ was purchased second hand and installed
in the early 1920s, it was manufactured by the firm of Gray and Davison. In 1975, the
Font of Caen stone was removed from the rear of the Church to its present position at
the side of the choir stalls.
Much of the interior of St. Mary’s we see today is the work of (Sir) Giles Gilbert
Scott, his first commission was the new altar in 1909. This replaced the original
wooden altar. The altar steps were covered in birds eye fossil, the frontal and gradus
of the altar were constructed out of Verde di prato marble. His Triptych depicting
several Manx saints. Scott’s High Altar was rebuilt in 1970 so as to comply with the
new requirement of the priest offering Mass facing the people. Scott then went on to
design a new altar and reredos for the Lady Chapel, which was carved by Stuflesser in
Italy and erected by Farmer and Brindley of London. His work extended to the niches
that house the statues of St Anthony and St. Joseph, candlesticks, and in 1922 the
bronze altar rails (excluding the gates which were added in 1950 by Fenning and
Company).
In 1862, the first of the present Stations Of The Cross were erected, two more were
added that year and the remainder in the 1870s. The Mission Cross was made in 1859
and is a life-size figure of Christ carved in wood by Theodore Phyffers.
The Presbytery has accommodation at lower ground, upper ground, first and second
floors. The upper ground floor is at the same level as the Church. On this floor is an
original screen with leaded glazing, with the exception of this only items of joinery
including doors appear original.
It is recommended that St. Mary’s of the Isle be placed on the Register of Protected
Buildings for the following reasons:
1 Aesthetic quality
2 Uniqueness of architectural/design
3 Landmark qualities
4 Exceptional interior work by an international acclaimed architect/designer
