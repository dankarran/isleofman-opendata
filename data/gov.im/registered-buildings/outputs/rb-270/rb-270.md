DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
ITEM FOR MR RONANS CONSIDERATION 
 
To: 
 
Mr R Ronan MHK, Member for Planning & Building Control  
From:  
Mr Stephen Moore, Building Conservation Officer 
Subject: 
Confirmation of the Registration of The Harbour Masters Office 
East Quay, Peel 
 
Date:  
28th May 2014 
 
 
1. 
Introduction
1.1 
To update and inform Mr Ronan of the progress of the registration, outlining 
the comments received and seeking confirmation of the addition of The 
Harbour Masters Office to the Protected Buildings Register. 
2. 
Background 
2.1 
Whilst this building does not specifically appear on the Proposed List of 
buildings to be considered for addition to the Protected Buildings Register that 
dates back to 1976 and 1982, back in 2008, Peel Heritage Trust requested that 
the Department consider the building for Registration.  This was followed up in 
March 2009 with a request from the owners of Seaforth House in Crown Street, 
Peel. 
2.2 
Various pieces of work have been carried out over the intervening years on this 
part of Peel, but the research was carried out on a number of properties in this 
immediate vicinity including; The Customs House, The Old Police Station and 
Seaforth House. These were all brought forward as proposals. 
2.3 
The Notice of Proposal to Register was issued on the 26th March 2012 with 
representations requested by no later than 17th April 2012. 
3 
Policy and Legal Implications
3.1 
 
Regulation 14 The Protected Buildings Register of The Town and Country 
Planning Act 1999 states: 
(1) The Department shall continue to maintain a register of buildings of special 
architectural or historic interest, called the Protected Buildings Register. 
 
3.2 
The research and addition of buildings to the Protected Buildings Register is 
therefore in line with the Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning Act 
1999. 
3.3 
POLICY - RB/2 - IDENTIFICATION OF BUILDINGS FOR REGISTRATION from 
the Departments Planning Policy Statement 1/01 - Policy and Guidance Notes 
for the Conservation of the Historic Environment of the Isle of Man, sets out 
that buildings may be identified for entry in to the register in several ways:- 

 
 
2
 
The building may already appear in the provisional list drawn up by the 
Department for the purpose of recommending buildings for registration; 
 
Buildings judged worthy of investigation with a view to registration may 
also have been identified in the area plan;  
 
Buildings may also be added to the provisional list following proposals 
from Local Authorities, special interest groups or other bodies or 
individuals, that a particular building or buildings should be considered 
for registration, or protection by way of a building preservation order  
pending registration; and 
If it comes to the notice of the Department that a particular building may merit 
registration and may satisfy the criteria set out in RB/1 above, then the 
Department may itself propose such a building for registration. 
3.4 
Peel Heritage Trusts request is therefore in line with policy RB/2. 
4 
Summary of representations received
4.1 
The Isle of Man Natural History & Antiquarian Society wrote in support on the 
17th April 2012 commenting: Together with the above the Society welcomes 
the tact that together the Registration of these two buildings and their 
boundary walls will help reinforce retention of the street pattern which is 
historically deliberately designed so as to mitigate the impact of wind, sand and 
sea into Castle Street and whose breach would be very undesirable in 
townscape terms. 
 
4.2 
Manx National Heritage wrote in on the 17th April 2012 welcoming the proposal 
to Register. 
4.3 
Peel Commissioners wrote in on the 17th April 2012 agreeing to the addition of 
the building to the Protected Buildings Register. 
5 
Resource Implications 
5.1 
There are no immediate staffing resource implications for the Conservation 
Section associated with the progression of the research and potential 
registration of this building. 
6 
Conclusion 
6.1 
Having considered the content of the research into The Harbour Masters Office 
and the comments offered by The Peel Commissioners, The Isle of Man 
Antiquarian Society and Manx National Heritage, the exterior of the building is 
of obvious architectural and historic interest and is correspondingly considered 
worthy of entry onto the Protected Buildings Register. 
7 
Recommendation 
7.1 
Mr Ronan is invited to consider the content of this report, the representations 
received and having done so, is recommended to confirm the entry of The 
Harbour Masters Office to the Protected Buildings Register.

Dear Madam, 
NOTICE OF PROPOSAL TO REGISTER A BUILDING 
17TH April 2012 
The Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society wishes to record their appreciation of the Department of 
Infrastructure's consultation on the Registration of buildings. The Society generally welcomes involvement in the 
research into and conservation of Historic Buildings and Structures and hopes it may be more involved in such 
consultations in the future. 
In offering comments on the registrations the Society is assuming the Department has already undertaken fairly 
detailed studies Into the architecture and history of these buildings. 
In relation to the current proposed Registrations the Society would offer the following 
Scarlett HOuse It is particularly pleasing to note the inclusion of this building being an lS,h century dwelling albeit 
"vlctorianised "internally. 
The Society notes that it's setting to the shore is included. The Society would have liked 
to see the induslon of the old farm buildings to the south (Lower Scarlett on the plan) as it Is believed that these 
were developed on an empty site In the second decade of the 18th century and would therefore possibly be earlier 
than the house. Moreover should any development take place in relation to these it could adversely impact on the 
view of Scarlett House obtained from the public footpath and car park to the south . However it is aware that the 
Quarter1and was heavily fragmented, as Is reflected in the Ballad on the death of IIIlam Dhone 
Great wealthy Scarlet" down at the shore, 
Its choicest portions are a wild desolation} ; 
The poor cast,' down heir has not a scrap to eat; 
And thy death, Dliam Dhone, 'tis that breaks our heart 
We believe these buildings were probably retained by the heirs to John Osborne Lucas Christian after seiling the big 
house in the 171970's17 and now belong to W.LE. Christian of Ellerslie and his mother. 

It is also known that there was a ronnection between Scarlett and Knockaloe Mooar the heiress of the former 
marrying James Quirk 1760 -1810 heir of Knockaloe, and possibly responsible for developing the oldest structures 
ofthat farm. 
Glvn Maar. Glen "GOIr Road. St. Johns The Sodety recognises that this was the home of Moore of Moore's Mills 
but has lillie else to add at this stage. 
Lome HpuR. Cas!:l!!tpwn The Sodety particularly welcomes the registration of this building and its setting. The 
Sodety previously made detailed response in relation to an earlier planning application and would reiterate these In 
response to the current Registration Proposal. 
Peel Police Station (formerly Peel Court Housel. Derby Road. Peel The Society recognises that this 
building with its cells underneath is a unique building and worthy of Registration per seE 
Old Police Station Crown Street Peel The Society welcomes the recognition being given to the architect 
Thomas Brine with the Inclusion of this building and its boundary wall. 
The Harbour Office. East Quay. Peel Together with the above the Society welcomes the tact that together 
the Registration of these two buildings and their boundary walls will help reinforce retention of the street 
pattern which is historically deliberately designed so as to mitigate the impact of wind, sand and sea into 
Castle Street and whose breach would be very undesirable in townscape terms. 
In summary the Society supports the Registration of all the above. It is particularly welcome to note the Importance 
being given to the building's settings and not just the buildings themselves. 
Kind regards 
c.lBryanl!

1.1 To inform the Chairman of the proposal to add the Harbour Master's Office, East
Quay, Peel to the Protected Buildings Register.
1.2 Background
1.2.1. On the 9" May 2008, Building Conservation received a request from the Peel
Heritage Trust
to consider a number of buildings for addition to the Protected
Buildings Register including this-one.
1.2.2 We also received a letter from Peel Town Commissioners dated 15" May 2009
requesting that we consider registering the Harbour Master’s Office and the
Coastguard Building on the East Quay, Peel.
1.2.3 These requests are in line with Policy - RB/2 Identification of Buildings for
Registration within Planning Policy Statement 1/01 - Policy and Guidance Notes for
the Conservation of the Historic Environment of the Isle of Man which states:
“Buildings may be identified for entry in to the register in several ways:~
Buildings may also be added to the provisional list following proposals from Local
Authorities, special interest groups or other bodies or individuals, that a particular
building or buildings should be considered for registration, or protection by way ofa
building preservation order pending registration”
1.2.4 Asa result of this, we commenced research on the building, to ascertain its
worthiness for addition to the Protected Buildings Register.

Introduction 
The Harbour Masters Office is a two storey red sandstone building located on the junction of East 
Quay and Crown Street in Peel on the Islands west coast (Plates 1a & 1b).  The building occupies a 
prominent location on this busy quayside and stands out due to its red sandstone construction and 
its notable oriel window.  
History 
 
  
Historically, the Crown land on which the Harbour Masters Office was constructed belonged to Sir 
George Moore (1709-1787) a highly successful individual who had made his fortune running 
contraband goods, particularly tea, from Amsterdam to the island and so circumventing the normal 
trade routes into Britain (A Short History of Peel. L.Quilliam 1999). His success was reflected in the 
large house he owned in Crown Street along with much of the neighbouring land adjacent to the 
shore which he used as a recreational green for his family, as indicated in Corris map of 1784  
(Plate 2). Whilst a substantial part of the land indicated in this map was later swept away by the 
sea, the remaining plot of land was to later become owned by the Crown, though no details are 
available. A proportion of this land was subsequently developed during the nineteenth century as 
reflected in the buildings currently occupying the site today. Despite this much of the area has 
remained undeveloped. 
Many early maps of the area, along with numerous variations, can be unclear in their factual 
depiction of specific buildings when it comes to identifying land use/occupancy over the years and 
therefore clarification is required. In the mid nineteenth century, it is reported that the site of the 
Harbour Masters Office was occupied by a public house known as Winters and the site of the 
adjacent Customs House was occupied by a public house known as the Watch House (Morrison S., 
1914). In her book Manx Inns, A pub crawl through history, Suzanne Cubbon states that the inn 
known as the Watch House was kept by Tom Corkan who was also the Harbour Master and it was 
used as an office by the tide waiters (1998, p.113). This would therefore suggest that the site was 
already being used for official harbour business prior to the present buildings being constructed. 
Comparing the photographic image taken in the late 1800s to that of Mannins 1825 engraving, 
(Plate 3) it was surmised in the Crown Street article in Manxnotebook, that Winters public house 
was possibly the two storied house on the quay, whilst the other building being possibly the Watch 
House, another public house described as being just around the corner.  

2 
 
By comparing Corris map of 1784 to the later 1869 Ordnance Survey map (Plate 4 & 5) the building 
outlined in red, though not identified, would appear to occupy the site of the present day Harbour 
Masters office, though clearly pre-dating it. This would identify it as Winters public house, though 
there is no indication of the adjoining Watch House on Corriss map at this time, though the later 
Ordnance Survey map of 1869 clearly indicates the Watch House. By aligning the quay-side taken 
from the 1869 map (dashed yellow line) and the warehouse location to that of Corriss map it can 
be established that no other developments had taken place outwards towards the quay which might 
otherwise have conflicted with our current understanding of the site. 
 
Credence should not therefore be given to that of Blacks map of c1910 (Plate 6). This was 
apparently based on an earlier map dating from the late 1890s and whilst it indicates the location 
of the Customs House, it appears to occupy the site of the Sailors Shelter giving no mention as to 
the Harbour Masters Office or the nearby Police Station. As such this map should not be considered 
as a true and accurate representation of the site. 
Perhaps the earliest photograph available showing the quayside area formerly owned by Sir George 
Moore and referred to as The Green helps clarify matters (Plate 7). Whilst the Police Station can 
clearly be identified to the left of the site with its pronounced hipped roof, this would date the 
photograph from after 1847. The public houses on the site previously named are less well identified 
and if anything it is the depiction of Winters House of 1825 that bears a passing resemblance to 
this later photograph.  Based on the fact that the Police Station is clearly indicated here, in addition 
to the fact that the Rocket House is not present, as it was built in 1876, the image depicted here 
would appear to be from the early/mid 1850s whilst the building occupying what is now the 
Harbour Master Office must, according to previous reports, be Winters public house. 
By 1863 the public houses on the site had been demolished and the present Harbour Masters 
Office (along with the Customs House) had been constructed. Other buildings which have been built 
on the former Crown land include the adjacent Sailors Shelter (1876), the Old Police Station (1847) 
along with the Rocket House (1876, rebuilt c.1960). The remaining undeveloped Crown land was 
previously used for a timber yard and a boat building businesses (Goodwin G., 1914), and it is 
currently a works yard for the Harbours Division of the Department of Infrastructure. 
The Harbour Masters Office was originally used as both an office and a house for Peels Harbour 
Master, but this changed during the mid 1990s when the Harbour Master moved out and the 
building was converted into a coastguard centre (see Planning Application number 93/01147/B) 
though still commonly referred to as the Harbour Masters Office/Building and retained by the 
Department of Infrastructure.  
Architecture 
Constructed on Crown land, the Harbour Masters Office complements the other administrative 
buildings built in the immediate locale, the former Customs House and Police Station. The building 
itself serves as a fine example of what is generally regarded as late Victorian administrative 
architecture, in so much that the design of the building was in part dictated by its role/function 
based on an established architectural format which blended functional period detailing with 
elements of neo-classicism which imparted such buildings with an air of authority. In the case of the 
Harbour Masters office this was emphasised by means of rusticated sandstone quoins to the 

3 
 
corners of the building and also to the doors and windows which serve to accentuate the buildings 
social role giving it an air of officialdom and grandeur despite its limited size. This was further 
emphasised to considerable effect by means of the upper bay window (Plate 8). Located directly 
above the front door, the oriel window, constructed from timber, projects from the first floor 
principle elevation overlooking the quay. This is perhaps the key feature to the buildings implied 
status as it incorporates the classical symbolism of a pediment surmounting the bay window. This 
itself appeared to employ heavy mullions which served to place greater emphasis on the use of the 
pediment giving the impression of columns, the resulting classical theme being best viewed from a 
distance, suggests that of a balcony as opposed to merely a window (Plate 9). Though the window 
has changed little over the intervening years the impression of heavier horizontal mid-rails to the 
sash windows in-conjunction with the paint scheme adopted now serve to slightly diminish the 
original effect.  
Overall the building consists of two storeys and forms a simple rectangular footprint with the 
addition of a small two storey extension to the rear. The main external walls are constructed with 
red sandstone blocks whilst the hipped roof employs a natural slate covering. It is generally 
accepted that the red sandstone buildings in this area of Peel were usually constructed with stone 
quarried from Creg Malin, or in some cases allegedly reused from derelict buildings in the Castle. 
However, in this case the late construction date would preclude the use of reclaimed materials from 
the castle, though it was said that the old public house known as Winters which formerly occupied 
the site is said to have had a stained glass window that had been taken out of the Cathedral 
(Goodwin G., 1914). 
The elevations most visible to the general public are the front elevation to East Quay and the side 
elevation to Crown Street, finished in sandstone. In contrast to this, the remaining side elevation, 
rear elevation and the majority of the rear extension have all been rendered. Where the external 
walls have not been rendered, cement pointing has been applied in order to give the exterior a 
more dressed appearance, a not uncommon practice attributed to Victorian sandstone buildings 
throughout Peel. Given the buildings exposed location and the nature of the material, the façade of 
the building has taken on a slightly cupped appearance over the years as the sandstone blocks 
have gradually weathered back from the mortar joints over time (Plate 10). This effect has served 
to contribute to the buildings character as its features have gradually lost their sharpness over time 
to taken on a softer, more weathered appearance. In addition to the above there is a plain 
sandstone cornice which runs along the south and west elevations and is positioned halfway up at 
first floor level. 
Archive photographs show that the original windows (at least to the front elevation) were traditional 
Victorian timber sliding sashes with a two-over-two format. These arched headed windows were 
the same design as those on the front elevation of the adjacent Customs House on Crown Street 
and also the Sailors Shelter on East Quay, though both of these other buildings have retained their 
timber windows. Unfortunately, here the original timber sliding sash windows have been replaced in 
recent times with UPVC casement windows, most probably during the buildings refurbishment 
following its change of use in 1993.    
When the Harbour Master moved out of the building in the early 1990s and the subsequent 
conversion into a coastguard centre around 1993, minor internal alterations took place within the 
main building at this time along with a ground floor window and door being blocked up. However, 

4 
 
the most significant of the alterations took place to the rear of the building where the existing two 
storey rear extension was altered and extended in order to incorporate a garage, giving access onto 
Crown Street. Internally, the building retains little by way of period features, other than the stair 
bannisters and mouldings around a few door heads (Plate 11). The cumulative effect of these 
changes, whilst losing what remained of the original interior period features has resulted in a shift 
of interest to the buildings exterior. Other than a reduction in the height of the chimney from 
original, the only visible and detrimental change being the uPVC replacement casement windows. 
Overall, the property retains its essential landmark features and what changes that have taken 
place to the exterior are reversible. 
In conclusion 
 
The Harbour Masters Office on the East Quay in Peel is an important part of the Conservation Area 
and an attractive, prominent building on the harbour side. The loss of this building would be 
detrimental to the maritime history and architectural fabric of Peel. In conjunction to the Harbour 
Masters House, there are other Victorian administrative buildings in the local area, such as the 
Customs House and the Old Police Station, which together have significant group value. 
Whilst recognising the importance of retaining this local landmark building, it is acknowledged that 
by nature of the works undertaken to refurbish the former Customs House, the interior of the 
building does not significantly contributes to the proposed Registration of this building and as such 
the emphasis of Registration is placed on the buildings exterior. 
In summary, the Harbour Masters Office is worthy of inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register 
for the following reasons; 
1. It is a particularly fine example of Victorian official architecture. 
2. It has historic interest, as it represents Peels civic and maritime history. 
3. It has group value in conjunction with the nearby Victorian administrative buildings. 
4. It is a fine building utilising particularly well detailed local sandstone construction. Sandstone 
is indigenous to and synonymous with Peel and it is therefore important to protect fine 
examples of local historic sandstone buildings as they are an important part of the towns 
character. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The Harbour Masters Office on the East Quay in Peel is recommended for addition to the Protected 
Buildings Register by reason of its Architectural Interest and/or Aesthetic Quality, its Historic 
Interest and for its Group Value as defined in Policy RB/1  Registration of Buildings as set out in 
Planning Policy Statement 1/01 - Policy and Guidance Notes for the Conservation of the Historic 
Environment of the Isle of Man: 
 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST AND/OR AESTHETIC QUALITY: The register is intended to 
include buildings which are of importance to the Island for the interest of their architectural 
designs, decoration, craftsmanship, or by virtue of the eminence of the architect; this would 
include important examples of particular building types and techniques (e.g. buildings 

5 
 
displaying technological innovation or virtuosity, as might be found in structures connected 
with the historic railways of the Island) and significant plan forms; 
 
The building is a fine example of late Victorian administrative architecture which utilises the local 
Peel sandstone, embellished with rusticated quoins and surrounds to the windows and a finely 
detailed timber oriel projecting bay at first floor level. The simplicity and solidity of design reinforces 
the administrative authority of the building and its importance to Peels civic and maritime industry. 
 
 
HISTORIC INTEREST: This includes buildings which illustrate important aspects of the 
Islands social, economic, cultural, religious, agricultural, industrial or military history; this 
importance might also be assessed in the particular local context of the town or village in 
which the building is located; 
 
It has clear historic interest, as it represents a fine visual link with Peels civic and maritime history. 
 
 
GROUP VALUE: Especially where buildings comprise an important architectural or historic 
unity or a fine example of planning (e.g. Squares, Terraces or Farm Groups). 
 
The Harbour Masters Office, in conjunction with the Customs House and Old Police Station in 
Crown Street, represent and important historic group of administrative buildings in Peel.

“The Custom House and Harbour Office were built in 1863 (sic) on site of an old public house 
known as ‘Winter’s . . . Next to Winter’s, round the corner, in Crown Street, stood a smaller pub-
lic house, kept by Tom Corkan, who was harbour master at the time. This was afterwards known 
as the ‘Watch House,’ and was used as an office by the tide-waiters”

and the later expansion of the quayside. 
 
The building outlined in red, though not identified on this map, would appear to occupy the site 
of the present day Harbour Masters office, though clearly pre-dating it, with no indication of the 
adjoining ‘Watch House.’ However, by comparing this map to the later Ordnance Survey map of 
1869 (Plate 5) which clearly indicates the Watch House, it is possible to align the new quay 
(dashed yellow line) and warehouse in order to establish that no other developments had  
taken place outwards towards the quay over the coming years.

The Ordnance Survey map of 1869 records the location of what was commonly referred to as the 
Watch House, This later map would appear to indicate that the Watch House occupied the site of 
the later Customs House, not the Harbour Masters office as some sources state. This is 
confirmed by a reference in the Peel City Guardian dated 25th March 1939 concerning changes 
that had occurred throughout Peel prior to 1889.

Black’s Map of c1910 based on an earlier map from the 1890’s, indicates the location of the        
Customs House, however, this would appear to occupy the site of the Sailors Shelter with no 
mention as to the Harbour Masters Office or the near-bye Police Station and as such should         
not be considered as a true and authentic representation of the site.

Note the building on the left appears to be in a ruinous state - either through demolition in      
progress or as a result of wave damage which was recorded on a number of occasions            
as being responsible for demolishing properties in and around this area. 
Visible on the top left is the Police Station whilst in the bottom right of the pictures appears to be 
a warehouse facing a corner development.

Landmark Qualities 
 
The Harbour Masters Office - perhaps the most prominent and enduring of Peel’s quayside buildings. 
Note the classical  emphasis of the oriel window created by employing a pediment 
 and accentuated mullions.
