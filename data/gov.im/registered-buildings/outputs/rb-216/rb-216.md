SEA CLIFF,
BALLURE ROAD, RAMSEY.
Historical Notes
Introduction
Sea Cliff lies within Ballure quarterland, in the treen of Ballure, in the Parish of
Maughold. The other quarterlands which make up the treen of Ballure include
Ballastole, Ballacowle and Clenaige. Ballure is the only one of these quarterland
names which is still in use today, and the name Ballure itself means ‘yew tree’ or
‘home of the yews’.
Ballure quarterland included the land which is now on both sides of Ballure Road, the
land in Ballure Glen and up to where the present reservoir now is, plus the rough
Lhergys south of the Glen. For many years the quarterland was home to a Christian
family, who were extremely influential in Ramsey. In later years the Christians were
to sell plots of their land for the Ramsey Waterworks, the Manx Electric Railway, and
for the extension of the town up Ballure Road
Sea Cliff belongs to a small group of houses situated between the shore and Ballure
Road which were almost certainly buill as merchant's homes, possibly in the
eighteenth century, when access io Ramsey would still have been limited before the
harbour was built. Each building has its own individual features but as a group they
are remarkably similar with their proximity to the shoreline and private routes down
to the sea, which were used for the trading. Sea Cliff is located on the main road into

Ramsey from Laxey and Maughold, which was also previously the main route to and
from Douglas.
The house appears on the earliest Ordnance Survey maps of the area which were
surveyed during the 1860's. On these maps the house is referred to, as Seacliff House
and it looks remarkably similar to the property we see today with the route down to
the shore also being visible. From comparing the old Ordnance Survey map with a
modem map it is evident that no major alterations have taken place at the property
during this time, with the exception of an adjacent house which was built in 1911 on
land belonging to Sea Cuff.
Prior to Ballure Road, the only access to these properties would have been along the
shore and up the cliff} this route was also used by residents of Ramsey on their
journeys to the ancient parish church of Maughold and Ballure Chapel.
The two more recent properties directly on either side of Sea Cliff were both built by
the owner on land belonging to the property in 1847 and 1911. In the Abstract of
Title it is recorded that these two adjacent properties have right of access to the
pathway between the houses for which right they have to pay one shilling per year.
Also in the deeds, it is noted that the owner of Sea Cliff historically owns part of the
seashore in front of the property, up to the high tide mark.

Architectural and Historical Interest
Extemally Sea Cliff appears to be built in the traditional Manx farmhouse style with
two stories and a five-window elevation. Internally, however the property gives the
impression. of being much more of a wealthy gentleman's residence than a farmer's.
At some point in the past, some of the features in Sea Cliff look as if they have been
updated, for example the staircase, which is quite grand, almost Victorian in style but
is probably too small in scale to be Victorian. It is made from good timber and its
size suggests it to be Georgian.
There is still evidence of servants at Sea Cliff as the conservatory at the back of the
house appears to have previously been servants quarters, perhaps a wash house. A
recent addition to the property is the bathroom extension on the first floor at the back
of the house.
The entire roof was replaced in 1970 and dormer windows were placed on the back in
order to give better light to these rooms. The new roof was built slightly higher than
the old in order to give the bathroom more height and looking at Sea Cliff today, the
roof appears to be higher than would normally be expected in such a house. During
the time when the roof was replaced an old conservatory at the back of the house
collapsed.
Both of the houses on either side of Sea Cliff were built on its land. The first was
Grosvenor House which was built in 1847. It was granted by deed of token to the
sister of the owner of Sea Cliff for £10. The house on the other side was built in 1911
by Billy Blair who was the manager of the shipyard at Ramsey. It was designed by

Hewitt Crellin who was a friend of Baillie Scott, and William and Constance
Radcliffe used 1o live there.
Historically, there were three forts which were established for the protection of
Ramsey harbour and bay; one of these forts was at Ballure, near to Sea Cliff. The
fort had rampants built of sods and it was only fully equipped at times of war scares,
such as during the French War of 1693, the American War of Independence in 1782
and during the French Revolutionary War in 1797. The last records of the
refurbishment of Ballure Fort were about the year 1800.
Sea Cliff, Ballure Road, Ramsey is judged worthy of entry into the Protected
Buildings Register by virtue of its special architectural and historical interest on
the following grounds:-
Landmark Qualities:-Sea Cliff is located on the main road into Ramsey from Laxey
and Maughold, which was also previously the main route 1o and from Douglas.
Despite the property being located on a main road, it does not possess any noteworthy
landmark qualities; it is more significant for its group value with some of the
surrounding properties.
Group Value:-Perhaps the most important characteristic of Sea Cliff is its association
with a number of other properties along Ballure Road, these former merchant's houses
situated on the cliff have retained their distinctive routes to the shore which were used
by the traders. Each house possesses its own individual features but as a group they

are remarkably similar with their proximity to the shore, paths to the sea and with
their origins being around 1700-1750. These houses are believed to date back to the
early eighteenth century and today they are some of the oldest surviving buildings in
Ramsey.
In addition to the other former merchant's homes, Sea Cliff is also connected with the
two properties directly on either side. These houses were built on land belonging to
Sea Cliff in 1847 and in 1911.
Age and Rarity:-The owner of Sea Cliff states that the Abstract of Title (which is
currently not in her possession) dates back to 1800, but she has found evidence of the
property back to 1720 which would make it without a doubt one of the very oldest
surviving buildings in Ramsey. This would mean that Sea Cliff pre-dates Ballure
Road, which dates to 1764. Up until the construction of Ballure Road, access to
Maughold, Ballure Chapel and Ballure Mill from Ramsey, was along the beach and
up the cliff at the present Fountains Apartments, or along the shore up through Ballure
Glen.
In, conclusion, Sea Cliff merits entry onto the Protected Buildings Register on
account of its age and its origins as a merchant's home, this was a typical building
within the historical context of Ramsey in the eighteenth century, but very few
examples of these homes have survived, which makes Sea Cliff even more significant.
Perhaps most importantly, Sea Cliff should be noted for its group value through its
associations with some of the adjacent properties, in particular East Cliff and Beach
Cottage. The property also has connections with the two properties located directly
on either side which were built on its land in 1847 and 1911.
