Introduction and Purpose
‘The purpose of this paper is to consider the application to remove the former Farmers’
Combine Warehouse from the Protected Buildings Register.
‘The paper has been updated since its first consideration on 10 June 2019 when the
matter was deferred to seek legal advice and have a meeting with the applicants to seek
clarity on their reasons for seeking de-registration.
‘A meeting was held with a representative from the Attorney General's office who
confirmed that the decision needs
to be made on the basis of the criteria within the Town
and Country Planning Act 1999 (the Act) and the Operational Policy on the Principles of
Selection and that it would not be inappropriate to meet with the applicant to explain that
they would need to provide reasons for their application. A meeting subsequently took
place and following that a supplementary statement has been submitted. This is attached
in full for consideration, but Is also summarised in the report at paragraph 3.3.
Additionally, since the previous report was considered, Ramsey Town Commissioners
have formally reconfirmed that they do not wish the building to be registered. The
number of signatories to the petition now numbers 773, although the weight to be
apportioned to the petition in determining the application remains limited as most of the
submissions give no reasons why the proposal to remove the building from the register is
supported and the information on the web-site is misleading. The Assessment
paragraphs have been updated in the light of the additional information.
Background
On 7 November 2018 the Minister agreed to issue a Proposal to Register Notice with
respect to the former Farmers’ Combine Warehouse situated at 33 West Quay Ramsey.
The Notice was served on 9 November 2018.
A response
to that a letter was received on behalf of the landowner objecting to the
proposal. That letter was accompanied by a report undertaken by BWB Consulting that
provided a description of the building fabric, its historic development and an assessment
of the architectural and historic interest of the building in the national context. That report
concluded that overall the aesthetic condition is now poor - noting that:
«the building holds a degree of architectural and historic interest evidencing the mid-
19" Century expansion of settlement and illustrating the industrial character of
historic development along West Quay, much of which has been lost through
redevelopment and clearance;
© the retained fabric broadly illustrates the historic form and function and the
vernacular character of the original construction including the use of traditional
material and construction methods; and
‘the building has undergone significant alteration and adaption most notably the
application of render and reworking of openings (a number of window openings have

23
24
25
2.6
27
been altered or blocked off), a number of headers and sills are absent or
unsympathetically replaced and a number of interventions are apparent internally.
Ramsey Commissioners wrote supporting the registration on 6 December 2018 following
their meeting of 21 November 2018.
Letters of support were also received from the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian
Society, the Victorian Society and a private individual. These letters set out reasons why
they feel the bullding Is worthy of inclusion in the Register. In summary these indicated
that:
the building was erected around the 1850s or earlier;
it is typical of warehouses once common in Douglas and Peel but now lost;
it is built of local stone;
the building tells of its historic use;
the original cathead still exists;
it is the last untouched warehouse in Ramsey that portrays not only its own
architectural history but the development of Ramsey;
«the involvement of Rechabites - who owned the building ~ adds to its unique status;
and
* itis a dominant and important part of the street scene.
At the Policy and Strategy meeting on 9 January 2019 a paper was considered which
sought endorsement of the addition of the building to the Protected Buildings Register. An
advice report had been prepared assessing the building's interest and outlining the
comments received as part of the consultation and this was also considered and noted.
The Registered Buildings officer acknowledged the assessment made on behalf of the
owners. He accepted that the condition of the building is poor and that there has been
some alteration to the building. He felt however that there still remains a level of
intactness and survival of features, including the substantial timber joists, historic
windows and plan form that are of architectural interest. He felt that the building is one
of few surviving structures dating back to the development of this part of the quay and is
an example of the industrial and trade development of Ramsey.
The intention was noted to preserve what is historically important about the building
rather than setting it “in aspic”. The issue of a Notice of Registration to formally endorse
the addition of the property to the Protected Buildings Register was agreed.
On 17 January a letter was recelved from Ramsey Town Commissioners setting out that
they further considered the proposal at their meeting dated 16 January 2019. They
indicated that they considered the contents of the report by BWB which had not been
available to them when they first considered the proposal. They subsequently considered
that the reports advised that the building had no historic merit and as such they had
determined to withdraw their support for the Registration. As the Notice of Registration
had not been issued, the Minister considered the contents of the letter but determined it
raised no new information that had not been considered by the Policy and Strategy
Committee. The decision was ratified by the Minister on 6 February 2019 and the Notice

dated 14 February 2019 was served on 15 February 2019.
The formal Registration is attached to this report.
The Application to De-Register the Building
The application to de-register the building was submitted on 6 March 2019. The reasons
given are summarised below.
The previous report by BWB Consulting concluded that ‘having regard to the extent
of
alteration to building, in combination with deterioration and loss of original fabric, it
fails to meet the level of special architectural or historic interest in the national
context to merit adaition to the Register. This is of necessity, a high test, and
requires robust consideration and selectivity’
Astructural appraisal undertaken by Graham Schofield Associates commissioned by
the owner dated July 2018 concluded that ‘o/d buildings such as this one experience
structural deterioration asa result
of two factors:-1. Abuse and neglect
of the
building during its functional lifetime and 2. Ingress of water and gaps opening up to
the building’s fabric to allow natural weathering to occur.’ A Structural Assessment
Report prepared by The Morton Partnership, Consulting Civil and Structural
Engineers, dated September 2018 was commissioned by the Department and
concluded inter alia that ‘the building could be brought back into full use but at a high
cost’, Since the removal of the portal frame building adjacent further details of the
dangerous condition of the building is more evident.
© Following consideration of the reports Ramsey Commissioners are now of the view
that ‘the building has no integrity, no future viable purpose and no historic merit.’
The Directors of the management company of the neighbouring building has emailed
the owner of 33 West Quay expressing concern about the very poor condition of the
building and vermin infestation and suggested that here were multiple far better
preserved properties along West Quay.
The applicants comment that as the Department was not required to give detailed
reasons for its decision it is not known to what extent the Department had regard to
the representations made by the owner and in particular to the reports from BWB and
Graham Schofield Associates, nor is it apparent how the Department arrived at its
conclusion that the building is of special architectural or historic interest.
It is the owners’ submission that the bullding does not have any special architectural
or historic interest; that the property is structurally in a poor condition and is beyond
economic refurbishment; that the building does not contribute to its current setting
on West Quay; and the continued registration of the building acts as a potential
impediment to the beneficial development of the building and the adjoining site. The
‘owners suggest that they would undertake to maintain a record of the building and
preserve any item of interest such as the hoist gear and housing.
‘The reports by BWB, Graham Schofield Associates and the Morton Partnership were
submitted in support of the application. The application was also accompanied by a letter
from Ramsey Town Commissioners to the applicants dated 5 March 2019 as referred to
above.

A suppiementary statement has been provided by BWB on behaif of Shearwater
Properties Limited (17 July 2019). In that submission they set out the statutory criteria in
the Act and the Principles of Selection that further defines special interest. They indicate
that construction in the 1850s means that a degree of selectivity needs to be applied.
They note that the building has a degree of historic interest being part of the mid-19"
century expansion of Ramsey, it did not form part of the historic core of the earlier
settlement of illustrate association with any nationally important person. They feel that
whilst it is of interest in the local context of Ramsey, given the building type and use, in
combination with the dating, that it is not of special interest in the national context. From
an architectural point of view, it is a typical functional design with no significant
architectural elaboration or decoration. It exhibits no significant technological innovation
in terms of architectural treatment or layout. With respect to the machinery they state
that is of 20" Century dating and are ‘fragmentary’. They highlight the extent of later
alteration and adaption during the 20" Century including the coarse sand and cement
render masking original fabric and detailing and being of poor aesthetic quality, widening
of the door, alteration of openings and substantially diminished architectural interest and
authenticity. They highlight that the Principles of Selection indicate that the appearance
of a building ‘is a key consideration in judging registration proposals’, Finally they indicate
that the statutory requirements of the 1999 Act seta high test in the determination of
special interest in the National context and they believe that the Farmers Combine
buildings fails to satisfy this.
The application has not been subject to further consultation following the receipt of the
supplementary statement as it provided no substantive new information,
Representations
Highway Services: No highway interest (22.3.19)
Ramsey Town Commissioners: In an email received on 27 June 2019, RTC reconfirmed
their views submitted on 17 January 2019 which are referred to in paragraph 2.7 above.
Manx National Heritage provided initial comments (29.3.19): Registration does not
preclude change or development, it gives certainty to owners that they have an asset
rather than a liability. Registration should challenge owners and the community to find
innovative ways of re-use and experience shows that the increased scrutiny of the
development usually produces better quality outcomes in time. Registration makes a
‘strong presumption against demolition. MNH would expect the owner to commission a
Conservation Statement to inform their understanding of the significance of the structure
which would inform development.
Manx National Heritage provided additional detailed comments as set out below (5.6.19).
‘* MNH fully support decision to register this building.
© The research undertaken by the RB officer, the Victorian Society and the Isle of Man
Natural History and Antiquarian Society show that the building is of considerable

significance and rarity and is worthy of protection. Concur that it is of both historical
and architectural value.
Historical value arises from its construction as a warehouse at the time of expansion
and development of Ramsey as a port and settlement from being a port little changed
since the late medieval period.
© Today no.33 is sole warehouse surviving in anything akin to its original form out of
more than a dozen. As a surviving example it greatly enhances its significance.
© The building has distinctive visual massing and orientation, it preserves several more
specific features that enhance its value further, including recessed doors and the
cathead.
¢ Our understanding ofthe relevant legislation is that the building’s present structural
condition is not a material consideration in the process of deciding whether or not to
place it on the protected building's register, in this respect those aspects of the report
submitted by the applicant's structural engineer considering its condition are not
material to the question of whether or not the building merits protection, however the
Morton Partnership report is more pragmatic and sensitive in its approach in
demonstrating the structure viability of the building.
4.5 Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society provided detailed comments as set
out below (12.4.19).
» Object to the application to de-register the Building. Request interested Party Status.
«Confirm that they would repeat their submission to the Notice of Proposal to Register.
Fine example of early
to mid 19" Century stone built, slate roofed with its frontage,
albeit rendered, intact. The frontage is unique in Ramsey, others have not retained
their original features. Internally it retains its massive baulks of timber holding the
upper floors which maybe unique feature structurally as well as a flywheel, sack hoist
and chute. The building provides important visual character and historic context. The
building represents a time when the quay was expanding and led to the growth of
Ramsey. Warehouse likely to be instigated by Thomas Kneale.
° The Society accepts that as with all building not maintained there are clearly
Problems internally which would necessitate removal of much of the internal fixtures
of the upper floors but not to the extent of demolishing the whole...the fact that the
ground floor (is) still used to some extent is not taken into account. The inclusion of
the asbestos report is a red herring since the report's findings refer largely to the
Barry Curran buildings which are already being demolished and a small patch within
the former office.
© The assertion that it is beyond economic repair is unsubstantiated by any figures and
does not take into account the cost of refurbishing the wall of the apartment block
next door and other such matters.
* Registration is about the history and architecture of a property, not its condition or
the economics of repairing it. The Society argue that there is opportunity for the
developer to design a high quality development that takes into account the
architecture of the building.
4.6 Petition submitted by resident of Ballakesh Farm (21.3.19 and 8.4.19) initially with 610
signatories and then a further 16 making 626 in total. The writer states that ‘the builaing
6

47
48
4.9
48
is an eyesore and beyond repair, the decision to register had hindered progress and
developers should
be encouraged to regenerate brownfield sites’
‘The main petition does not, in itself, set out reasons why the warehouse building should
be removed from the register however the change.org website, through which the
petition was organised states:
“The old Farmers Combine Warehouse building has stood neglected
for many years. It’s
is
an eyesore
and of no use
as it is, Development of brownfield sites should encourage
[sic]. I’m sure the people of Ramsey would rather see the area regenerated and
improved. The proposed development will provide employment to the town.’
It was also noted that at the time of writing this report (5.6.19) 655 people had signed
the petition.
Comments were also provided on a separate sheet. The comments made can be
‘summarised as:
Building is an eyesore
Blot on the landscape
Passed the point of repair
Should have been protected a long time ago
Vermin are present
New development should be allowed
‘A 200 job creating development has been thwarted
Has no use
Incompetence/blindness/stupid idea/ridiculous
‘Owner/occupied Ballachurry Farm (31.3.19): The building should be preserved for
posterity and the future. If it is demolished it will be gone for good, it should be
renovated and preserved for future generations. Architects and owner should have
incorporated it into their plans. Ramsey lost too many of its old and historic buildings
thanks to the mistakes of the 1950s-70s. Although in current state it may be dangerous It
was fine for veg shop to be in there for last 6-8 years so shell should be reasonably
sound.
Glen View, Laxey (13.4.19): The building is important architecturally and aesthetically
because it is largely unaltered surviving example of a Manx stone warehouse including
original windows, doors and cathead hoist. Internally it includes the fixtures of the
flywheel associated with the hoist, the chute and the sack hoist. The timber baulks mirror
those in the dry dock frame on the opposite side of the quay and is likely to be associated
with it. Historically it appears to have been built in 1845 possibly by Thomas Kneale who
was landowner of the area where the quay was extended. The building is a landmark
because of its relative isolation. Not part of a recognized grouping, but 26 West Quay is
registered there is potential for the two buildings to ‘bookend’ any infill development.

Legal Issues
‘The means to designate Registered Buildings is set out within Section 14 of The Town
and Country Planning Act 1999 (The Act).
In registering a building the Department shall consider its special architectural or historic
interest.
An application may be made to de-register a building within 21 days of its registration, If
the decision is made not to de-register it, a further application may not be made for 5
years.
If a person wishes to apply
to be treated as an interested person the person must
indicate in his or her written submission the relationship between the person’s land and
the building that is the subject of the application. When it determines the application the
Department must decide which persons (if any) who have made written submissions with
respect to the application should be treated as having sufficient interest in the subject
matter of the application to take part in any subsequent proceedings relating to the
application. The applicant, the agent if there is one, the owner and occupier of the
building, Manx National Heritage and the local authority are interested parties by virtue of
Section 9(4) of the Town and Country Planning (Registered Buildings) Regulations 2013.
Reasons must be given for the decision whether or not it is to retain the building on the
register or to de-register it.
The decision can be appealed by the applicant or the applicant's agent and any interested
person in writing to the Department within 21 days of the date of the notice.
Policy
The application should be assessed against DEFA’s Operational Policy on the Principles of
Selection for the Registration of Buildings into the Protected Buildings Register. This helps
set out that the statutory criteria is that the building be of architectural or historic
interest.
Architectural Interest: To be of special architectural interest a building must be of
importance in its architectural design, decoration or craftsmanship; special interest may
also apply to nationally important examples of particular building types and techniques
(e.g. buildings displaying technological innovation or virtuosity) and significant plan forms.
Historic Interest: To be of special historic interest a building must illustrate important
aspects of the nation’s social, economic, cultural, or military history and/or have close
historical associations with nationally important people. There should normally be some
quality of interest in the physical fabric of the building itself
to justify the statutory
protection afforded by Registration.

6.4
7.
7A
in appiying the statutory criteria and considerations, as set out above, the Department
will also consider the following principles:
‘Age and rarity. The older a building is, and the fewer the surviving examples of its kind,
the more likely it is to have special interest. The dates are indications of likely periods of
interest and are not absolute. The relevance of age and rarity will vary according to the
particular type of building because for some types, dates other than those outlined below
are of significance. However, the general principles used are that: (i)before 1800, all
buildings that contain a significant proportion of their original fabric are likely to be
registered; (ji) from 1800 to 1860, many buildings may be worthy of consideration for
Registration; (ii) after 1860, because of the greatly increased number of buildings erected
and the much larger numbers that have survived, progressively selection is necessary;
(iv) particularly careful selection is required for buildings from the period after 1945; (v)
buildings of less than 30 years old are normally registered only if they are of outstanding
quality and under threat.
Aesthetic merits: The appearance of a bullding — both its intrinsic architectural merit and
any group value — Is a key consideration in judging registration proposals, but the special
interest of a building will not always be reflected in obvious external visual quality.
Buildings that are important for reasons of technological innovation, or as illustrating
particular aspects of social or economic history, may have little external visual quality.
Selectivity: Where a building qualifies for registration primarily on the strength of its
special architectural interest, the fact that there are other buildings of similar quality
elsewhere is not likely to be a major consideration. However, a building may be registered
primarily because it represents a particular historical type in order to ensure that
‘examples of such a type are preserved. Registration in these circumstances is largely a
comparative exercise and needs to be selective where a substantial number of buildings
of a similar type and quality survive. In such cases, the Department's policy is to register
only the most representative or most significant examples of the type.
National Context: The Isle of Man is a separate entity to the UK and the unique context of
the Island's historic development must be taken into consideration as part of the selection
process. Special interest is likely to be conferred on buildings which may not be the case
if they were in the UK, given the Island’s unique context.
State of Repair:
The Department should register a building which has been assessed as
meeting the statutory criteria, irrespective of its state of repair or other factors such as
implications for future use or financial issues.
Assessment
The reasons for the application to de-register set out are:
(® the building falls to meet the level of special architectural or historic interest due to the
extent of alteration in combination with deterioration and loss of original fabric;
(id the building has suffered structural deterioration and it could only be brought back

8.2
into use at high cost;
(ili) Ramsey Commissioners are of the view that the bullding has no integrity, no future
viable purpose and no historic merit;
(iv) that the building does not contribute to its current setting; and
(v) that its retention is a potential impediment to redevelopment.
Points (Ii) and (v) are not material considerations as acknowledged in the Principles of
Selection under State of Repair.
In terms of whether the building has special architectural or historic interest, and
secondly whether the building contributes to its setting, these are a matter of judgement.
The applicants argue that its special character has been lost by alteration and
deterioration. These were matters considered at the time of the original decision to
register the building when it was acknowledged that the condition ofthe building was
poor and that some alteration had taken place, but that the remaining building retained a
level of intactness and survival of features. Its historic value is also not considered to
have diminished as a result of its state of repair. In terms of whether the building
contributes to Its setting, it is noted that even new buildings are designed to reflect the
vernacular of the former warehouses and as a quayside building it is clearly at home
within its setting.
In terms of the representations made in support of de-registration, it is understandable
that people are concerned with the appearance of unused bulldings and what place they
hold for the future. It Is not clear how many people signed the petition in the belief that
the registration is preventing a particular development that would bring forth many jobs
to the area, No such proposal is evident and in any case is not a material consideration in
the determination of whether a building should be registered or not.
It is also understandable that people believe the building is an eyesore and that could be
seen as a material consideration given that the Principles of Selection include aesthetic
quality. The building is vernacular/functional (rather than being ‘polite’ architecturally)
but this is not reason to dismiss it automatically, many buildings, including those on the
Island are vernacular, such as those at Cregneash. Arguably it is the state of repair that
the bullding Is in which causes it to be an eyesore, and if repaired could be a valuable
addition to the street scene.
Those representations made that object to its de-registration provide further confirmation
of its architectural features and historic context.
Conclusion
The supplementary statement provided looks methodically at the statutory criteria as well
as DEFA's Operational Policy. The statement does not provide new information as such,
rather the consideration of the building against the criteria has been reassessed and is re-
confirmed. The bullet point summary of the historic and architectural quality of the
building is not disputed. All parties agree on the date, history and physical state of the
building, however the applicants argument is that the building is simply not special
enough, particularly in the national context, and that a high bar should be set for the
registration of the building. The objectors’ views are that it does meet that bar,
particularly given how few of these buildings remain and that it is important in its context.
Given the balance of the competing views, in making the recommendation below,
significant weight has been given to the views of Manx National Heritage given their
statutory role on the Island.

Consideration of Interested Person Status
As stated above the Registered Building Regulations sets out that when it determines the
application the Department must decide which persons should be treated as Interested
Parties. DEFA’s Operational Policy on Interested Persons does not apply to applications to
de-register a building. Nevertheless it does state that persons who wish to apply must
indicate the relationship between the person's land and the bullding that Is the subject of
the application. This is presumably so that a decision can be made as to the impact of
the decision on that person’s land. None of the parties have done this. Accordingly it is
recommended that no parties are to received Interested Person Status, other than those
who automatically receive it under paragraph 9(4).

In pursuance of powers granted under the above Act and Regulations the Department of 
Environment, Food and Agriculture determined to APPROVE an application by Shearwater

Warehouse 33 West Quay Ramsey Isle Of Man    from the Protected Buildings 
Register for the following reason(s): 
 
1. 
In considering the application to de-register the building, taking into account the 
Statutory Criteria set out in the Town and Country Planning Act 1999 and the Operational 
Policy on Principles of Selection for the Registration of Buildings 2018, and the 
representations made, it was determined that the entirety of the building did not reach a 
sufficiently high bar to be of architectural or historic interest in the national context. 
 
Sections 14 to 16 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1999 impose special controls on 
the demolition, alteration and extension of registered buildings. As this property has been 
removed from the Register, those controls cease to apply to it. 
 
The effect of this decision is that the property has now been removed from the Protected 
Buildings Register, and therefore is no longer accorded Registered Building status.
