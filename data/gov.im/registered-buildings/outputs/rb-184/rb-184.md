CHURCH COTTAGES, ST MARK’S
In 1827, when the Reverend John Thomas Clark was appointed Chaplain of St
Mark’s, he found the Church and Parsonage in a terrible state of repair. Assisted by
the great Church-building Bishop, William Ward, Clark set to work to improve the
buildings.
By 1830, he had replaced the Parsonage with a new building and in 1843, he
instigated the building of the schoolhouse and adjacent master’s house.
In 1846, Reverend Clark rebuilt the disused former school into the first pair of Church
Cottages. Their purpose was to generate rents that would be used to keep the Chapel
and new Schoolhouse in repair. There are inscriptions in stone tablets contained
within pediments over the doors of each cottage and within a further pediment
between them. These read (from left to right): ‘T J Clark Chaplain, I Bridson esqn
Trustee’ ‘St Marks Cottages erected AD 1846’ ‘Dr T V Short, The Lord Bishop”.
The third of the Church Cottages was added in 1899, it too has an inscription above
the doorway which reads: “Bishop Straton Cottage Rev A J Holmes Chaplain 1899’.
It appears that the cottages were separately occupied until August 1980, when they
were purchase as a whole by Lady Dowty. In addition to the cottages the conveyance
included: ‘the right title and interest Gf any) of the vendors in and to the triangular
area of open land adjoining such cottages.’
In 1981, when an application was lodged for planning permission to convert the three
cotlages into a single dwelling, there was a great deal of local debate as to whether
‘the church’ had actually owned this land and had the right to convey it. It was
variously described as ‘common land’, ‘the Village Green’ and the ‘Fair Ground’, it
was said to have been used by the parishioners for various events for many years.
However, the sceptic tank and drains that serve Church Cottages are now situated
beneath the land and ownership seems to have been passed. It is still used by the
community at certain times, such as St Mark’s Fair Day.
On a photograph dating from 1953, the general external appearance of the cottages is
very similar to that of today. The main walls to the cottages, front boundary walls and
the chimney stacks all appear to be in unrendered stone, with limewash applied to all
but the chimneys. Today, all external surfaces are finished in a textured render, which
was probably applied as part of the conversion in 198]. At the same time, what
appears to have been a Manx slate roof was replaced with Welsh slate.
Replacement windows have been fitted, and whilst a Georgian-style has been retained,
top-opening sashes have replaced sliding sashes and in some windows the number of
panes and the configuration of the glazing bars is different. The doors to the original
pair of cottages have been replaced, whilst that on the later cottage has become a
window.
Prior to 1981, the dry closets were situated adjacent to the cottages where a utility
room has now been built. Other external changes include, provision of a side window

overlooking the grass triangle and the blocking-up of three small wire-mesh apertures
in the rear elevation overlooking the graveyard. Three roof lights have also been
installed on the rear roof pitch.
Internally, the cottages have been extensively altered, all external walls have been dry
lined with plasterboard, and nothing remains which is of historical importance. The
first pair of cottages share a joint chimney stack, topped with four chimneys. The
third cottage has its own stack, with a pair of chimneys that replicate the style of its
neighbours and also that of the nearby schoolhouse.
Whilst externally there have been changes made to Church Cottages since 1981, their
basic form remains broadly similar and as a group they largely retain their original
character. Together with St Mark’s Church and the Schoolhouse, they form an
important link in the development of the hamlet. In isolation, it could be argued that
inclusion in a conservation area could adequately protect the structure. However, as
part of the group of ecclesiastical buildings on the central triangle of land in St
Mark’s, it is considered that addition to the Register of Protected Buildings would be
the appropriate protection for the buildings.
It is accordingly judged that Church Cottages, St Mark’s be added to the Register of
Protected Buildings on the following grounds:
1. Architectural style and aesthetic quality.
Historical association in the development of the hamlet.
3. Close historical association with Reverend John Thomas Clark, who was known
as the ‘Patriarch’ of St Mark’s.
4, Group interest with the Schoolhouse and St Mark’s Church, forming a unique
grouping of ecclesiastical properties.
