description Castletown Police Station,Oastle Street ,Custletown
The single storey stone iding has a pitched slate roof and abutts
adjacent structurss on either give of the corner Setweon Castle Sbrert
the The Quay. The corner itself is murked by a circular turret with
conical roof and a bend of vertically proportioned reotungul
wc wind
which repeat elsewhere on the two facades.There is an entrance on
street indicssed by a single door width semi-circular heuded opening
in the stonewerk.The re are also two curved gable extensions which cut the
eaves line sandwiching the chimney to the corner turret from he Quay,
and marking the junction with the o cent building on Cu e Street.
The general character of the architecture,though at psins to complenent
Castle Rushen on the opposite side of the road gives a goneral wir of
discosfort in ita expression in which the turret seems somewhat contrived.

recommendation
Because ‘ciitect was Baillie Scott vhore is a tendurcy to list
the building for thit reason alone lowever its architectural curio) J
yelue usy carry a8 muck weight even though some of it's aspects could be
considered dubious.The marriage of "castic oxpresSion"ia such a smal)
building gives an impression thoi tne design is overworked. Whereas such
numerous elements have been successfully intes od ir some of tho lop
Doighis “srisas of the Arts ond Craft Movement fle they do not appear
to lend themselves » peadily to a police station solutior.Joveve. in
bulance it is suggested to list the building for preservation as on
6
maple of the architect oub of his normal context.
