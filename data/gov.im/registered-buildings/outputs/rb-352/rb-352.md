Register Entry Summary – Douglas Railway Station Signal Box 
 
Details 
Name: Douglas Railway Station Signal Box 
Address: Douglas Railway Station 
Register Entry Number: 352 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025  
 
History 
The Signal Box, sometimes referred to as the Points Box, was erected in 1892, and supplied by 
Dutton & Co of Worcester. When installed, the building controlled the majority of the points and 
signals around the extensive station complex and the distance signals down the lines to Peel and 
Port Erin. 
 
Following the closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines in the 1960s and their lifting in the 1970s, the 
layout and extent of the station at Douglas was significantly reduced. The signal box remained in use 
until the end of the 1980 season, following which the lever frame was disconnected. 
 
In 1998 further alterations to the station were made, including the replacement of the historic 
carriage shed with a modern structure located north of the running line to the west of the 
workshops complex. Following this, the signal box was no longer adjacent to the remaining station 
track formation. A decision was made to retain the building, and to physically move the structure to 
a more suitable location adjacent to the current station track plan. During 1999 the move was 
undertaken. A concrete raft was cast under the building, and it was then jacked up and moved 
across the yard to its current location by traction engine Pride of Mona and AEC Matador.  
 
Although no longer connected to the points or signals within the station, the building is opened for 
special events and forms part of the tours around the historic station complex. In recent years the 
building has been the subject of repair works externally and restoration work internally, with the 
lever frame painted to reflect its appearance when first installed. 
 
Details 
The ground floor of the building is constructed in dark brick with quoins and surrounds in Ruabon 
brick. The first floor is constructed in timber (horizontal panels between structural timber 
framework), with a duo-pitched roof finished in natural slate with terracotta ridge tiles. Decorative 
barge boards and spike finials in painted timber. A brick chimney stack extends above the roof on 
the building’s south-western corner. 
 
The ‘box contains a 36 lever frame also supplied by Dutton & Co, is a surviving example of the 
Dutton 1889 Patent. The levers feature numbered (and in many cases labelled) brass plaques that 
correspond to the lever’s purpose on the station diagram on display on the northern wall of the 
operating room, and which was supplied by Dutton. This diagram shows the station layout with 11 
‘roads’ (railway lines) at its eastern end, with platforms for trains to Peel, trains to Castletown/Port 
Erin, and an extensive goods yard on its southern side. 
 

The lever frame installed at Douglas was Dutton’s least successful, and as a result the example at 
Douglas is the only one to survive in situ anywhere in the world. At the time of writing, one further 
example survives in storage as part of the National Railway Museum collection. 
 
Signal repeaters are situated on the North wall beyond the levers that controlled the two distance 
signals, as these signal arms were not visible from the signal box. The signal wire adjusters for both 
of these distance signals are still in place – used historically to tighten or loosen the signal wire as 
required by weather conditions to keep the signal mechanism operational. 
 
The building has storage at ground floor level and the main operating room at first floor level. A 
single four-panelled painted timber door on the eastern wall gives access to each level. The storage 
room includes a large oak beam supporting the signal lever frame at high level. 
 
Within the operating room at first floor level, a fireplace is located against the southern wall. Painted 
timber-framed windows run the full length of the north elevation and return around the east and 
west elevations for three panels. The windows have two intermediate horizontal bars, dividing the 
glazing in to three panes. The windows have horizontal sash openers, with chamfered arch heads 
within the box frames. On the East and West elevations, the southern-most window panel of the 
three is fixed (i.e. does not have a sash opener). 
 
A painted-timber staircase and landing platform extend from the east elevation, with a single four-
panelled painted timber door (matching the ground floor door) providing access to the lever room. 
The staircase landing is supported by two angled timber beams supported on corbels projecting 
from the building’s eastern wall. Access to the base of the staircase is controlled by a vertical slatted 
painted timber gate. Two modern brackets housing CCTV cameras have been fixed to the building at 
high level. Any opportunity to re-site these cameras away from the building’s historic fabric would 
represent a positive conservation outcome for the building.
