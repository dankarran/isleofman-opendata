ST MARK’S CHURCH, ST MARK’S
St Mark’s Church was consecrated on the 23" of June 1772 by Bishop Mark
Hildesley, who had personally contributed £217.10.00 towards the cost.
In the year 1771, local inhabitants petitioned the Governor and the Bishop regarding
the need for a place of worship closer than Malew Parish Church, The petitioners
graphically described that in winter they were unable to reach the church due to severe
weather and poor roads, as most of them lived some four miles from the Parish
Church and some up to six miles.
The Governor and Bishop gave every encouragement to the undertaking and Hugh
Cosnahan of Ballakew, a member of the House of Keys, and Thomas Fargher of
Shenvalla were authorised to collect subscriptions. They purchased a portion of the
property calied Dreem-freaie meaning ‘heathery ridge’. Later parts of Cleighrouyr
meaning ‘thick hedge’ were acquired and Ballagaley for the Parsonage House, School
and Glebe. It would appear that initially the church was either poorly constructed or
not maintained, as when the Reverend John Thomas Clarke was appointed chaplain in
1827 he found the building in a ‘shocking state’. It is reported that he found the floor
of the Chancel aisle and pews to be made of clay instead of wood, the gallery
remained without a ceiling and no paint had been used on the interior of the chapel. It
is recorded that Reverend Clarke remedied the defects of the church.
Amongst those buried in the churchyard are the first trustees, Hugh Cosnahan and
Thomas Fargher. Mr Fargher’s memorial in the graveyard is by far the largest and
most striking. The first burial was that of Margaret Callister in December 1778.
Many residents of Foxdale were also buried at St Mark’s prior to the opening of St
Paul’s Church in Foxdale in 1874. Reverend Clarke buried his first wife at St Mark’s
and the same grave holds his eldest son and a daughter.
St Mark’s Church has solid stone walls of slate and granite, finished in render.
However the exposed bell-cote on the west end of the church is unrendered and
constructed in granite. The tower is in the form of four pillars with segmental brick
arches, supporting a square cap, conical roof and weather vane.
A particular feature is the existence of square finials, eight of which ornament the
tower. Originally another four stood at each comer of the roof, but these were
removed due to the ingress of water around them, and placed on the gate pillars at the
east entrance to the churchyard.
A sundial appeared in the churchyard in 1849, although it was replaced in 1919-1920.
When the church was last repainted externally, a slate plaque over the entrance doors,
the lettering on which was obliterated, was rendered over. The inscription ‘St Mark’s
1772’ was then painted above the doors.
The entrance doors have been replaced in recent years. They lead into a vestibule that
has a single door to the left, leading up to the organ loft, and double doors ahead into
the chapel. The organ came from Malew Parish Church in 1907, having been built by

H W Hewitt of Leicester in the 1880s. It is likely that the organ dates back to the
1830s, as Hewitt’s speciality was rebuilding scrap organs. The organ was sited in the
chancel until 1981, when it was restored and moved to its present site by Peter Jones
of St John’s.
The organ loft was referred to as the gallery by Reverend Clark in 1827, but may not
have been included when the chapel was first built. A plan dated 16" April 1773,
shows no vestibule or gallery and it is clear from this plan that the pew positions have
been changed. Reverend Clark referred to pews with doors missing and few having
desks or kneeling boards. It would appear that the pews referred to are not those in
the chapel today, as they do not have doors and all have desks. This opinion is re-
enforced by the haphazard numbering on the pew ends. These numbers go has high as
twenty-two, when the plan of 1773 shows only twelve rows of pews, it is therefore
likely that the pews were obtained from another place of worship.
The plan of 1773 shows a doorway to the vestry, but as the vestry is not shown on the
plan, it has not been possible to determine if it was built at the same time as the
chapel.
There are four arched windows to either side of the chapel, these have a diamond-
pattern glazing formed in cast iron. Above the two arched windows to the west end of
the chapel are dormer windows, these are inset into the roof and provide light for the
gallery, which is now the organ loft. There is the suggestion that these were again a
later addition, as their glazing differs from the eight arched windows and they extend
below the line of the gutter.
The east window in the church is a memorial of the Reverend J T Clarke and his first
wife. Two other chaplains are also commemorated by brass plaques, the Reverends
Thomas Howard Gill and J S Lupton. Externally a tablet to the front of the church
commemorates those killed in the First World War.
On the wall of the chancel is a carved wooden plaque of a Bishop’s mitre, dedicated to
Bishop Mark Hildesley (1755-1773). It features dog-tooth carving which matches
detailing to the pulpit, reading desk and the doorway-surround to the vestry. The
accounts of Reverend Clark show that the font was replaced in 1863.
It is recommended that St Mark’s Church be added to the Register of Protected
Buildings on the following grounds:
1 Age. The property can be accurately dated as being constructed in 1772.
Architectural style and aesthetic quality.
3 Close historical association with Reverend John Thomas Clark, who was
known as the ‘Patriarch’ of St Mark’s.

4 Landmark qualities. St Mark’s Church is situated in an elevated position and
its bell-cote is visible for several miles in all directions.
5 Group interest - with the Schoolhouse and Church Cottages, St Mark’s Church
forms a unique grouping of ecclesiastical properties.
