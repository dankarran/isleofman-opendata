## Extracted details
* Architects: Richard Lane
* Builders: Benjamin Lane
* Construction: 12th August 1847 – 8th March 1849
* Reasons for registration:
  - Designed by Richard Lane and built by Benjamin Lane, both of Manchester, in the Early English Gothic Style with many features relating to the Decorative Gothic Period, the Royal Chapel retains much of its historic form, historic detailing and craftsmanship.
  - Constructed on an ancient site of Christian worship and dating from 1849, the Royal Chapel serves as Parish Church for the Village of St John’s as well as the National Civic Church for the Island where the Chapel-Court of Tynwald meets by tradition on Tynwald Day. The Chapel therefore illustrates important aspects of the social and civic history of St John’s, the surrounding area and the Isle of Man as a whole.
  - The National Assembly Site (Tynwald Hill) is the location of the Isle of Man’s annual Tynwald Day Ceremony. As the island’s principal civic space, the Assembly Site illustrates important aspects of the Isle of Man’s civic, social and political history, as well as having close historical associations with many nationally important people.
  - The Royal Chapel and associated man-made landscaping including the walled enclosure and tiered assembly site have a historic unity and historic functional relationship that provides a strong group value.

Register Entry Summary – The Royal Chapel, St John’s, together with the 
man-made landscaping containing the National Assembly Site and chapel 
pathway
Details 
Name: The Parish Church of St John the Baptist - The Royal Chapel, St John’s, together with the man-
made landscaping containing the National Assembly Site and processional pathway. 
Address: Main Road, St John’s IM4 3NA 
Register Entry Number: 341 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025
Note 
The Royal Chapel and National Assembly Site (Tynwald Hill) sit within a 19th century landscape 
resulting from major reorganisation in the 1840s: this saw the creation of a dumb-bell shaped walled 
enclosure encircling the hill, the newly built chapel, and the 110m gravelled pathway connecting the 
two. This entry on the Protected Buildings Register extends to the entire area within this walled 
enclosure, including The Royal Chapel, the dumb-bell shaped walled landscaping and the tiered 
National Assembly Site (Tynwald Hill). 
History of the Chapel 
There is limited information concerning the early history of the site, although available evidence 
indicates there has been a place used for Christian worship, on or near the present building, from at 
least the 10th Century AD. This is supported by the discovery of a runic cross that dates from about 
950 AD. The Manx name for Tynwald Hill - 'hill of John's Keill' - suggests that an early Christian chapel 
or keill existed in this locality. It is also possible the Norsemen who chose St. John's for their 
assembly did so because this was already a sacred place for the Celtic people of the Island. Whilst 
the site has long and historic links with Tynwald no special mention or references to the chapel were 
recorded until 1537. It remained a chaplaincy of St. German until 1949 when the Ecclesiastical Parish 
of St. John was created.  
Until the beginning of the 19th Century the main function of the chapel was that of a courthouse 
and despite the important ceremonial connections with Tynwald Day the building was allowed to fall 
into disrepair. By 1697 the condition was such that a collection was made amongst members of the 
House of Keys towards establishing a repair fund. In 1699 Bishop Wilson began the rebuilding of the 
chapel on a site to the west of the current chapel, on a site over which the northern wall of the 
processional way now passes. By 1792 the chapel was again in a ruinous state and became the 
subject of an interdict until 20th July 1793. When the Duke of Atholl was appointed Governor in 
1793 repairs to the chapel were put in hand.  
The chapel was again rebuilt in 1798 and some improvements were made by Bishop Murray in 1820 
at his own expense. In October 1820 the first resident Chaplain was appointed. By 1840 the building 
was once again in a very poor state and the opening of a local school in 1845 gave impetus to the 
calls for a new chapel.  

The foundation stone for the new (and current) chapel was laid on the 12th August 1847 and the 
Church was consecrated on the 8th March 1849. The total cost was £2,535 of which £1,500 was 
provided by the British Government, with the rest being raised by private subscription. The building 
was designed by Richard Lane and built by Benjamin Lane, both of Manchester. In addition to being 
the Parish Church for the Village it is the National Civic Church for the Island where the Chapel-Court 
of Tynwald meets by tradition on Tynwald Day. 
 
History of the National Assembly Site 
‘Tynwald’ is derived from an Old Norse word meaning ‘assembly field’, a term used throughout the 
north Atlantic where medieval Scandinavian influence gave rise to annual parliamentary gatherings.  
The earliest references naming the place are from the thirteenth-century Chronicle of the Kings of 
Man and the Isles, on both occasions recording gatherings which resulted in conflict. 
 
Early fifteenth-century references in the Manx statutes, by which time the Isle of Man was under 
English control, define a system of assembly which strongly parallels early descriptions of the 
Icelandic parliament Thingvellir.  The latter is known to have early tenth-century origins, and on this 
basis the roots of the Manx parliament are held to be of similar date, the popular distinction being 
that whilst Iceland has the oldest assembly derived from this tradition, the Isle of Man has the 
longest continuous assembly. 
 
Details – The National Assembly Site (Tynwald Hill) 
Tynwald Hill itself (also traditionally known as Cronk Keeilleoin - the hill of St John’s chapel) is a low, 
circular mound comprising four concentric tiers and rises to a total height of about 3.5m. The tiers 
have diameters of 25m, 15.5m, 10m and 6m respectively, whilst the height of each riser reduces 
gradually from about 1.1m at the bottom to around 0.6m at the top. The steps built in to the eastern 
side of the hill do not point directly to the current chapel – the steps are directed approximately 3.5 
degrees north of the centre of the current chapel. This suggests that the steps initially pointed at an 
earlier structure, possibly the Bishop’s chapel of 1699. 
 
The tiers are flat-topped so as to accommodate the chairs of dignitaries gathered for the annual 
open-air assembly held on Tynwald Day (July 5th), but these and the risers have been the subject of 
a modern maintenance regime to stabilise the earth and turf-covered and prevent collapse and 
erosion, so the dimensions provided are subject to variation.  Old photographs show that the hill has 
a more regular profile than was historically the case.  A popular tradition that the hill is constructed 
from material from every parish on the island (if present since the 10th century it predates their 
existence by about 200 years) possibly has its origins in a repair using material brought from the 
neighbouring parish which lies just 200m away). 
 
Details - The Parish Church of St John the Baptist - The Royal Chapel 
The chapel’s official name is noted as ‘The Parish Church of St John the Baptist - The Royal Chapel.’ 
The church has also been known locally as ‘The Royal Free Chapel of St John the Baptist’ and 
‘Tynwald Church.’ 
 
FORM AND MATERIALS: The Church has been built to a cruciform plan with a gallery, a western 
tower and spire, and an extended semi-hexagonal apse. The main entrance at the west end is 

through a narthex which forms part of the tower. This has large double inner doors to the nave and 
a door in the north wall giving access to the stair turret. In the south western corner of the nave is a 
stairway to the gallery. An open porch on the south western side of the building provides additional 
entry to the nave. External rear steps provide access to the Chapel’s vaulted cellar. 
 
The organ is at the back of the north transept with pews located in front including inscribed pews 
reserved for members of the House of Keys. There are also inscribed pews in the south transept 
reserved for the Speaker and members of the House of Keys. At the north western corner of the 
chancel where it joins the crossing is a raised carved stone pulpit with a door behind connecting to 
the vestry. Along the north wall are pews reserved for members of the Legislative Council and a seat 
for the President of Tynwald. Opposite on the south side of the chancel are the choir stalls and seats 
reserved for the Governor, the first Deemster, the Attorney General and members of the Legislative 
Council. A carved wood altar in the apse stands on a predella and is screened by riddell curtains and 
a small retable. There is patterned tiling with the steps to the chancel in Pooilvaish marble. In the 
gallery there are stepped pews either side of a central aisle with panelled balustrading and a door 
connecting to the tower.  
 
The structure is faced with dressed and coursed granite taken from the South Barrule Quarry and 
has dressed limestone around the door and window openings and other features. The main roof has 
eight scissor trusses with deep arched-braces under resting on corbels and there are trenched 
purlins. There is trussed timber vaulting over the crossing between the transepts. The church stands 
in a large grassed area with dwarf stone walls marking the boundaries. A long straight path 
extending from the main west door of the Church to Tynwald Hill has important historic and 
ceremonial meanings in the tradition and affairs of the Island. 
 
The Royal Chapel – Architectural Style and Elements 
The Church has been designed in the Early English Gothic style, however many of the features relate 
to the transitional changes which eventually developed into the Decorated Gothic period. There are 
diagonal buttresses at most quoins and intervening buttresses between the windows. The tower at 
the west end has a broached spire with a ball finial. Set into the spire are lucarnes and in the lantern 
is a pointed equilateral arch window with two small lancet lights and a quatrefoil in the tympanum 
with a hood mould over. Immediately below the lantern are clocks set in the north and south faces. 
The angle buttresses to the tower diminish in size in four stages and extend up to the base of the 
spire. In the south wall of the nave are three pointed obtuse arch windows with hood moulds. In 
between the first and second window from the west is an open porch with a pointed equilateral arch 
opening. The south transept has two pointed obtuse arch windows with another in the south wall of 
the chancel all in the same design as before. The north elevation is the same as the south except 
there is no porch and an obtuse arch doorway at the east end opens into the vestry. The west 
elevation is dominated by the tower, as already described, but it also has a large pointed equilateral 
arch doorway with a hood mould over and heavy framed entrance doors. The east elevation has 
lancet windows in each segment of the apse and there is a lancet window in the east wall of the 
vestry. At the apex of the gable to the chancel is a Bottony style cross.
