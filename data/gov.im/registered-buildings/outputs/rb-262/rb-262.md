Register entry description 
 
Summary of Principal Building 
A windmill probably for thrashing corn, constructed circa early to mid C19th 
 
Reasons for Registration 
The windmill at Ballawhane Farm has been added to The Protected Buildings Register for the 
following principal reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST AND/OR AESTHETIC QUALITY:  
*An example of a windmill tower constructed with mixed stones including beach boulders.  
HISTORIC INTEREST:  
* a rare example of a windmill associated with a quarterland farm. 
AGE AND RARITY: 
*The only substantial remains of an unconverted windmill on the Island.  
 
History 
The date of the construction of the windmill is not known.  It has been suggested that the 
tower dates from c.1870 (Kelly), but the building is clearly older than this as it was illustrated 
on a map of Ballawhane Farm surveyed in 1841 and it was again shown on the County Series 
map of 1869.   
It is also recorded in  Mona’s Herald on 30th May 1837  
“A farmer in the parish of Andreas has invented and erected a windmill calculated to thrash 
corn, at the rate of twenty stooks an house, bruise gorse and churn milk!” 
Given the windmills presence on the 1841 survey this is a possible reference to the Ballawhane 
windmill.

Windmills are a rare occurrence in the Isle of Man.  This is mainly because wind-power could 
not be easily controlled in the same way as water or horse-power, but also because wind in the 
Isle of Man can be unreliable, strong and overheating of the sails could lead to a fire. 
 
There were two large windmills which were at Ramsey and Castletown, and in addition to this 
there were also a handful of smaller ones on farms, such as at Ballawhane in Andreas.  This 
windmill at Ballawhane was in use from at least 1841 and it was most likely used in order to 
provide local farmers with power for thrashing corn. 
 
Details 
MATERIALS: 
The windmill tower is constructed with mixed stones, including local beach boulders which 
were most likely taken from the nearby shore at Blue Point.  This was a typical method of 
obtaining building material in Andreas and other northern parishes, as there are no stone 
quarries in the land, but plenty of stones available on the beaches.   
 
PLAN: 
A round tower  
 
EXTERIOR: 
A round tower ruinous with the cap and sails no longer remaining.  
 
INTERIOR: 
No internal features or floors, some structural beams remain however. 
 
Subsidiary Features: 
None
