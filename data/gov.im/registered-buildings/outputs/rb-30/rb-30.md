description Barclays Bank Ltd,Marke’ Bc @,Castltown
The two storey building is constructed of store with e curved front
wall following the street line and amending it's otherwise rectangular
plan form.The facade treatment applied to the two visible elevations
(being an end terrace) is best deseribed as ange.The semi~clrular
headed opsrings of the ground floor windows d door produce a vory
Squat proportion.The lower portion of the window and below the sill
has exposed stonework(cut regular blocks),the rch has exposed
brick(with no keystones)and the surround to the arch being roughcast,
outside 6 thin cement readered moulding.Phe windows of the second floor
are rectaagulur of more slender proportion loc»ted above their counter»
parts on the floor below but this level is marked by parallel string
courses(below gill and above head)which give a horizontal J 3
vying with the vertical elements of this floor and the neutral elements
at street level.Seemingly adopting a defensive attitu the parapet ia

No interior inspection wes sade.
recommendation
he is no coubt that the building enjoys a prominent location of
importance, Moreover as ire ald Custom House and Market Hall there
clear “istoric overtones to the building itself.It is not known aowevor
waether the original building suffered from such a paucity of architect-
ural resolution.At the risk of seeming binsed it is felt that ihe building
represents as strong a statement of indecision as is unfortunately possible
on so distinguished a site.
