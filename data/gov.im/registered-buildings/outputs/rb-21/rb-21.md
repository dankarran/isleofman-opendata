Hutchints Garden, Douglas
A Brief History of its Development 1700 -— 1900
It was in the 1690's that Henry Hutchin, a Douglas tradesman
acquired a large garden outside the town-from Deemster Parr,
who owned the farmland which formed a backdrop to the port.
Hutchin himself lived in King Street, then on the outskirts,
and it was to a close neighbour, Robert Key, that he sold
a half-share of his newly acquired plot. They were assessed
with the yearly rent of 2d per annum, payable to Lord Derby
as Lord of the Isle, which had formerly been part of Parr's
rent. The original deeds of sale which effected these early
transfers have sadly been lon> since Iost, so the original
description of the land can only be guessed at. The question
of access is also an interesting one, and it seems likely
that the main frontage of the gardens was on John Street,
North John Street seems to have been formed in around 1703,
when Deemster Parr sold another parcel of land “on the north
side of the sandy gardens in Duglass ... extending...westward
towards another new garfen Iately inclosed by Henery Hutchen
a.sleaving a sufficient passage of six yards breadth
betwixt the said two mentioned gardens for liberty to goe
in and out from the towne." To give an idea of the price
which Iand was fetching, Corris, the 1703 purchaser, paid
45/- for a garden roughly twice the size of Hutchints —
today Corris' garden lies under Barclays House car park, and
the property to the rear of Barclaytrust. Hutchin and Key
made a division of their land, Henry Hutchin retaining the
eastern half, nearer to the town.

With the passage of the act of Settlement, in 1704, titles
to land became much more secure, and with growing prosperity
thanks to “The Trade" the value of land around Douglas began
to rise. In March 1715 Robert Key and his wife sold half of
their garden to John Steane, a tailor, for six guineas,

—- a substantial price, which perhaps indicates that
development of the site was in the purchaser's mind,
Steane (or Stephen) did build on the site, and the house
was let to tenants when he settled various properties on
his only child, Margaret, prior to his death in 1752.
It was presumably the heiress, Margaret, with her husband
William Stephen, who squeezed a second house onto the site,
facing west onto present-day Church Street ~ at any rate
the Stephen holding was described in 1785 as comprising
"two dwelling
houses and gardens on the east side of
Qhurch Street where Mr George Booth lives",
Meanwhile, in the top (north-west) cormer
of Key's garden, a small plat had been sold off — the
present building, number 24 Church Street, is probably
the second to occupy the site, and was “abuilding" in I755,
when a mortgage for £16 was raised by the owners, Robert
and Esther Creer. The remainder of the garden, extending
eastwards behind Creer's house, and southwards to Stephen's
remained undeveloped, having changed hands for £3 10/— in
1737, when acquired by William Cain.
To the east, Henry Hutchin's land had
over a generation, became divided among his descengants;
a half share,
joining the western boundary, passed to
David Hutchin, of Tastletown; the remainder was shared
by Jane Hutchin, who married ¥illiam Corlett, and her
sister Aun, the wife of John Kermode. The Corlett’s had
one third of
the plot, in the north-east corner, where
they buil§ a house on the site now occupied by the
Card Shop. They were of course the ancestors of Sir
Mark Collett,
one+time Gavernor of the Bank of England,
The Kermodes held the remainder af the plot, with a frontage
on both North (or North John) Street and John Street.

Following the settlement by John Kermode upon his daughter
Christian, and her husband Charlies Moore, of his house
and grounds, the Moores puilt a second house, to the rear,
which they immediately sold to John Teare, for £130. Later
they moved to Ramsey, and sold the older house for a further
£73 to James Norrison, who also purchased part of the
adjacent garden from John Cannells heirs. Thé northern
half of the garden, however, was sold by CannelI's daughter
Leonora, with her husband, to John Teare, who added it to
his own property to the east.

Hills Estate - Phillip Mog#’e
Tt was in 1771 that Captain William Cowley entered the
story. Heuds ancestor of the writer, and it was to discover
his place of residence that the reported research was
started. For £52 I10/— he acquired John Teards house ard
garden, on his retirement from.,[iverpool in 1771.
Five years later, the chance appeared to buy the adjoining
garden from the Cain family, and he secured it for £16 10/.
William Cawley thus owned a strip of land running right
through from Church Street to Narth Jehn Street, and
bounded on the north, for the most part, by the Hills
estate, the property of the wealthy Moore family, who
had purchased most of Parrs land, During the thirty years
he lived in Worth John Street, Captain Cowley erected a
second house, adjoining his own, and a shed in the "gap"
which he owned £n the Church Street frontage. The value
of his property was greatly inereased however, when Paul
Kelly, one of the Town's earliest speculative developers,
bought a parcel of land to the north from the owners of
the Hills Estate, and proceeded to lay out a new Street,
now the upper half of Nelson Street, but originally
dubbed "Great George's Street." The development of the
northern side of the Street started in the F780s, but
either by accident or design, a narrow strip of land
had been left on the fopposite side, which prevented
William Cowley from taking access along his whole boundary
—S and seems to have prevented any development
there by him. Cowley sold out in 1807, for £450, to
a local tradesman, Robert Cannell, who tidied the
holding up in 1809 by purchasing the corner house with

Korth John Street (originally Corletts') and the offending
strip of land to the west. These cost him £125.
Cannell was able to erect commercial buildings on the
Land which be had acquired, and when the Coroner sold
Cannellts interests there in 1830, these comprised two
Qwellings in Nerth Street (North John Street) one in
Great George Street (upper Nelson Street) a Cooperage
in Church Street, and "yards, smithy, sheds and buildings"
alse on Great George Street. This whole coucern was
purchased py General Goldie, of the Nunnery, for £775.
The area in general had been improved
by the construction of the New Ramsey Road, to replace the
perilous track along the sea shore. The new road was
driven up through the Hills Estate from the junction
of North John Street and Great Georges Street, the
lowest section . . known as Prospect Hill, also
gave onto Athol Street, laid out by the Moore family.
General Goldie retained the houses
in North John Street, but sold the remaineder of the
holdingy almost immediately, the first sale being that
of the corner house, with one vacant plot, whieh wert
to Mrs Jane Campbell, for £500. The remainder of the
Great Georges Street frontage was sold for £200 to a
joiner and builder, John Shimmin, while the "gap" on
Church Street was developed, and then sald to John
Skillicorn for £50, [although this may be an artificial
figwre, as the purchaser was a mason, and had probably
done much of the work himself.) The commercial buildings
around the corner on Great Georges Street were torn down,
and the surviving terrace of dwellings erected, VEEP
shortly after 1830.
The other existing buildings in the block
now consist of Roseberry buildings, (which appear to be
of two dates, the mid-nineteenth century shop on the
north-east corner of the site,&the "Examiner" Office, of
1899,) and the adjacent warehouse.
