ST. PETER'S PARISH CHURCH, ONCHAN
St. Peter’s is not the first church to be erected on its present site.
The original church (which dated from about the twelfth century) stood
in what is now the modern graveyard, fifty yards North of the Western
door of the present building.
However, by 1760, the walls and roof of the chancel were in a dangerous
state, and although the building had a gallery and permission was
granted in 1771 for the erection of another one (according to church
records), the building being only 56ft. long by 15ft. broad, was too
small. This was a situation that lasted many years. Eventually, in
1829, the issue was resolved. At a meeting on the 22nd December, it
was decided to build a larger church capable of holding 500 people,
with a gallery at the western end. The building was to be high enough
to construct side galleries, if necessary.
The new building was to be erected on the Glebe land (roughly where the
present Vicarage is). All seemed in order and the foundation stone was
laid on the 8th July, 1830. However, some of the parishioners were not
happy with the site chosen and after some discussion it was decided to
use a more elevated and convenient site nearby. Therefore, on the 30th
August, the foundation stone was taken up and relaid by the Bishop,
with equal solemnity, on the current site
The design of the building was by Messrs. Hanson and Welch, architects.
They were also involved on work on other Manx churches (St. Barnabas in
Douglas and St. Mary’s at Ballaugh), and in the construction of Ring
William’s College (the pair later ran into serious financial trouble
when they were involved in the construction of Birmingham Town Hall,
which was a design of theirs)
During the construction, the builder, Johnny Sam Skillicorn (who was
said to be the wittiest wag of the Parish) had the gravestone of
Elizabeth Hayes (who died on the 25th February 1789), which had a
peculiar inscription, taken from the churchyard and placed as one of
the pediments over the spire louvres for the purpose of puzzling
posterity.
With the exception of some rough-casting at the eastern end of the
building, the Church has remained externally unaltered since its
erection. Internally, the restoration work of 1863 includes the
insertion of memorial windows as well as various alterations and
improvements, placing the walls and spire in a good state of repair.
Further work in 1913 covered the decoration of the interior and the
renewal of woodwork, while the beautiful oak screen across the front of
the chancel was erected in 1933 to mark the centenary of the building.
In 197] thirteen defective windows were replaced with new leaded,
stained-glass windows.
