MILNTOWN, LEZAYRE.
The original name for Milntown was Altadale a word drawn from the
Scandinavian, meaning "Swans' Glen". The North of the Island was one of the
first areas to be settled by the Vikings and the division of the Island into
Sheadings (Ship Districts) came into being with the Vikings. As Mrs. Hicks
Beach mentions in her book The Yesterdays Behind the Door :
No reason can be produced to disprove that the site of the ultimate house,
built by the Auldyn Stream, was that, or very near that, pitched on by the
pagan progenitor McKristin or McCrystyn - Son of Christian.
Mrs, Hicks Beach goes on to tell us:
From John McCrystyn.... 1408 until the year 1693, eight McCrystyns in
succession were, with two short gaps, Deemsters of the Northern half of the
Island.
In his book on Historic Homes of the Isle of Man, John Kitto explains:
In 1408, when it was owned by Deemster John Christian, it was called
Altadale, but in 1530 another Deemster John Christian, his grandson,
enlarged the house and planted extensive gardens and parkland, and also
improved existing machinery in the old mill, part of the property which had
probably operated in a more primitive form long before the Scandinavian
settlements.
Research into the family history of the Christians and Milntown was undertaken
by Mrs. William Bell Christian and continued by her daughter Rita: this resulted
in a mass of information.

In brief, there are four clear periods of Milntown family history:-
1) 1368 - 1568 The estate descended from father to son through eight
generations;
2) 1568 - 1673 The Christian family in bitter conflict with the Earls of
Derby refusing to respect the rights of the Manx
Nation;
3) 1673 - 1828 The family took up residence in Cumberland; and
4) 1828 - 1922 Return to Mann.
It was at Milntown that INiam Dhone Christian one of the most significant
figures in Manx History, spent his boyhood and it was in the Library ( with its
fine panelling formed out of Bog Oak, said to be taken from Close Lake) where
Illiam Dhone was tried. His brother (Deemster John), taking Illiam's son with
him, hastened to England and returned with an order from the Privy Council, to
deliver up the prisoner. They were either too late, or the order was ignored and
Uliam Christian was executed on January 2nd, 1663 within sight of Ronaldsway
Farm, then his home.
According to John Kitto (op cit):
In the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Milntown was used
regularly as the meeting place for the Sheading Courts: and in 1776 the John
Christian who was then head of the family erected a new battlemented
And the mahogany doors in the living room came from a wrecked Spanish
ship - some say the vessel of the Spanish Armada wrecked on the Manx
Coast.

John Christian of Unerigg, Cumbria returned to the Isle of Man and lived at
the Fort Anne for eight years. In 1830, when he returned to Milntown, it was
after one hundred and fifty years of the family's absence from the Estate and the
house was judged to be in need of some overhauling.
Changes were made to the stone battlemented mansion; the tower was brought
down to roof level as it was considered to be unsafe. New servants quarters were
built; two upper rooms were combined to form a larger Hall with a second
staircase and it seems likely that the former domestic quarters were remodelled to
form reception rooms. All the Jacobean plaster ceilings and the leaded glass of
the windows were done away with and new grates and chimney pieces were
installed everywhere. The house was finally plastered and painted and for the first
time took the form with which we are today familiar.
Externally, a new drive was made; the river bed was turned to make room for a
new road to the farm and the kitchen garden was enclosed by a wall.
By 1898 the Phoenix Life Assurance Company had taken over the property,
although the record shows that the Christian family were still in possession of the
house: a lady member of the family operated a Girls' School and it is understood
that the last male of the line died at Milntown in 1918.
In 1912, a large section of the parkland was sold off to certain persons from the
town of Ramsey for the creation of a Golf Course. The house operated for many
years as an Hotel, but then reverted to a private residence in which use it remains
to this day, being in the sympathetic ownership of Sir Clive Edwards. The said

owner has gone to great pains to restore the Mill with its external wheel and has
dredged the large Mill Pond which had silted up during long periods of disuse.
Milntown house and garden have been lovingly restored to the glory of days gone
by and the house and estate are a most worthy entry into the Protected Buildings
Register.
On March 9th, 1945, a letter signed J.H.Cleator appeared in the Ramsey Courier:
A few days ago it was announced by the B.B.C. that the British Government
had appointed experts on Town and Country Planning and Architecture
whose main object would be the preservation of all historical and beautiful
places. Our own Government ought to take the same course before it is too
late.
The Milntown estate is both historical and beautiful. It is the ancestral home
of the Christians and our national hero Illiam Dhone. The estate, even yet,
ought to be purchased by the Government and preserved as a National
park....

That Estate and those lands and premises known as Milntown House,
including the Old Mill, Mill Pond and Mill Race, together with the gardens
and parkland, all being situate in the Parish of Lezayre, merit entry into the
Protected Buildings Register on the following grounds:-
+3) CLOSE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION: with the Christian family
and in particular Manx National Hero Dliam Dhone Christian, who was tried
in the Library at Milntown and was subsequently executed by firing squad at
Ronaldsway in 1663;
2) AGE: it is generally accepted that part of the Milntown Estate was
one of the earliest sites settled by the Vikings. The house itself is based upon
what is probably one of the oldest dwellings on the Island to have remained
in continuous use throughout the recorded history of the property, which
goes back to at least 1368.
3) ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST: the survival of parts of the early
Jacobean house is most evident in the Library with its magnificent bog oak
timber panelling. It is also possible that the large flagstone floor in the main
entrance hall, is a survival from the early house. In 1830, the house was
subjected to a large programme of updating and remodelling: this took the
style of the Gothic Revival. Internally there are some fine decorative plaster
ceilings and period chimneypieces:externally we see characteristic use of
battlements and drip mouldings over windows, and the whole of the exterior
is finished in a heavily modelled lime stucco. The resulting composition is
imposing whilst also exuding a certain comfortable elegance.

The restoration of the Mill and the sensitive management of the parkland
setting also make a most important contribution to the value of this entry into
the Protected Buildings Register.
