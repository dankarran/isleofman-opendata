REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Farmhill Manor
ADDRESS: Farmhill Lane, Douglas.
POST CODE: IM2 2EF
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GRID REF: 353 761
Introduction
Farmhill Manor is a small mansion situated two miles south of Douglas. It is in
a rural setting, sited in mature parkland and surrounded with fine beech trees.
The main frontage is a particularly fine example of formal late Georgian
classical design with some features rare, if not unique, in the Isle of Man.
More important, but less apparent, is the clear evidence of development from
Quarterland farmhouse to stately mansion over the period 1725-1825. This
progression occurred in more than one step, and was attributable in part to the
acquisition of the property by a family closely associated with the government
of the Island at a key stage in its historical development.
History
Originally the holding was known as Ballaquirk and according to John Kitto, in
his book Historic Homes of the Isle of Man was in the possession of the Quirk
family from 1430. Nicholas Quirk died in 1785; his widow Catherine Quirk and
his heir William Quirk sold the property in 1788 for £730 to Senhouse Wilson
(1750-1825), then Receiver General of the Island, an English Crown
appointment. He settled on the island through family connection, Bridget
Senhouse, who married John Christian of Miintown in 1717. The Senhouses
were originally from Netherall, Cumberland and were the founders of Maryport.
Senhouse Wilson was one of a small group of gentlemen farmers who towards
the end of the eighteenth century started to use scientific methods of farming.
The sale of 153 acres included a house, dove houses, barns, buildings, stables
yards, gardens, lands, meadows, pastures, seedings, woods and underwoods.
At this time Senhouse Wilson also purchased Kewleys Meadow at Spring Valley
to enlarge the estate and it was he who anglicised the name Ballaquirk to
Farmhill.
According to J M Robinson's informant, (Guide to the Country Houses of the
North West. London, 1988) the property was built for Senhouse Wilson in the
“late 18" Century”. However this may have involved the addition of a new
front section to the original farmhouse, which today would comprise the central
five bays of the property, as was the case with the now demolished
Ballaughton farmhouse.

Architecture
The main frontage, facing south west, is double-fronted and symmetrical about
a central doorway and fanlight with a finely ornamented Doric porch. The
most distinctive features are twin semicircular two storey bays each with three
regular sash windows separated by full-height Tuscan pilasters. The main
cornice and entablature extends the full length of the fagade and may have
been modified at some stage, having a heavy top section. There are
prominent fielded spandrel panels between the two floors, and separated by
the pilasters. The original windows have been replaced in uPVC, but retain the
3/9 and 6/9 proportions of glazing. Flanking the bays are two flat end sections
with matching windows between pilasters.
The general look of the double pile, five bay fagade with shallow roof pitch is
redolent of three important houses, all on a slightly larger scale, which have all
been demolished.
1. Elm Villa, Ramsey, built by the Christians of an unknown date
2. Lhergydhoo, German, probably built after 1804 and
3. Buck’s House, Buck’s Road, Douglas, definitely built after 1800.
Comparisons have aiso been made with mansions close by, notably the
Arragon and Hampton Court, but these are tenuous. Some similar features
such as the bay and pilasters appear on Clifton House, Mona Terrace, Douglas
(now part of the Manx Museum) which was built a few years after this latest
stage of Farmhill Manor.
The Isle of Man Advertiser of 30° September 1824 records that Daniel Fleming
Wilson, son of Senhouse Wilson carried out improvements to Farmhill:
“The beautiful villa of Farm Hill, the property of DH Wilson esq., has been judiciously
and tastefully improved and is now one of the most elegant seats in the vicinity of
Douglas”.
These improvements probably included the two storey flat fronted extensions
to both sides of the building and the two storey bay windows and portico. The
facade unified by the application of two storey pilasters, a string course and a
substantial cornice. Unfortunately the article does not tell us the name of the
architect. John Taggart and Thomas Brine have been suggested, but Farmhill
does not possess their familiar trademarks. One possibility is John Pinch of
Bath whose most active period was between 1808 and 1827. Full-height bays
are rare in the Isle of Man but common in late Georgian Bath and Weymouth.
Behind the grand facade is an earlier and more traditional ‘big house’. There
are two main roof pitches with a central valley. The rear section is T-shaped
on plan with an outshot central gable on the back, containing a staircase of a
familiar 19" century pattern. This may be a replacement of the original when
the house was gentrified, as it is confined by the early plan and therefore
unusually narrow. There is a substantial spine wall separating the two gabled
sections. This and a slight change of level between the two main roofs suggest
that they are of different dates. If this is the case, Farmhill Manor can be said

to illustrate the development of the Manx ‘thie mooar’ in at least three stages:
a substantial T-shaped original not unlike Ballavilley, Santon, to which was
added a major full width range with a new symmetrical fagade which was then
gentrified with the major ‘improvements of the 1820's. It is likely that the
intermediate extension and rebuilding occurred soon after the house became
the residence of Senhouse Wilson, Receiver-General, in 1788.
Recommendation
Farmhill Manor is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register
for the following reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
A fine example of a minor country house converted from a substantial Manx
farmhouse in the period 1780-1825. The principal elevation to the south west
is a strongly modelled screen in the late Georgian style with semi circular bays
and regular fenestration separated by classical elements, Tuscan pilasters,
moulded panels and cornices. The central doorway has a 6-quadrant lead and
glass fanlight, pilasters with key- pattern incisions and a finely detailed Doric
porch with fluted columns and capitals with egg-and-dart ornament.
Behind the grand facade is a traditional double-gabled house of two substantial
storeys with lofts in the roof space. The front section may be a mid or late 18"
century extension of the original, which retains its T-shaped plan. The earlier
rear section contains a modestly proportioned staircase with familiar late
Georgian details. The roof is collared with two purlins on each side, and there
are loft windows flanking the chimneys in the end gables.
Historic Interest
The house is an exceptionally good illustration of the development of the Manx
‘thie mooar’ or ‘big house’ from Quarterland farm to gentleman’s mansion over
the century c 1725-1825.
Close Historic Association
Originally ‘Ballaquirk’, the house was renamed Farmhill on its acquisition by
Senhouse Wilson, Receiver-General of the Isle of Man and a member of the
Governor’s Council during the time of the 4" Duke of Atholl (the builder of the
Castle Mona). Senhouse Wilson was part of the elite of the Island, related
closely to the Christians of MilIntown and the Goldie Taubman family who were
major figures in the government of the Isle of Man.
Age and Rarity
Farmhill Manor survives as an excellent example of late Georgian improvement
of a more ancient structure. Much of the fabric is 18" century there may be
earlier sections of the building.
