THE NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK PROSPECT HILL
DOUGLAS
On 1st November 1853 George William Dumbell and his partner in Dumbell’s Bank,
Lewis Geneste Howard, commenced business after receiving a licence to issue notes.
In 1861, the business moved from St George’s Street to Number 1 Prospect Hill,
premises erected by Messrs Dumbell & Co for the express purpose of its banking
business. They opened for business on 23rd November of that year under the style of
Douglas and Isle of Man Bank.
Whilst the architect of the building is not known, during construction the Building
News described it as “Emanating from the pencil of a Liverpool architect”, but the
critic doubted that it was possible that such details could have been sent out of any
Liverpool architects office.
The external decorative appearance of the building is somewhat unusual, if not unique
on the Island. The stonework is finished in a smooth cement render, with worm-holed
quoins and decorative panels featuring extensively to the ground floor and to a lesser
degree at second floor level. The sash windows have ornamental balusters beneath
them and arched pediments above to the front elevation and triangular pediments, in
the Classical-style to the Nelson Street elevation. There are string courses at first
floor, second floor and eves levels, the latter two together with the chimney stacks
making extensive use of corbels. In addition to the main sash windows, there are bull’s
eye windows to either side of a central arched window on the first floor and both bull’s
eye window and irregularly shaped windows on the second floor.
The Ordinance Survey Map of 1869 shows the Bank on the corner of Prospect Hill
and Great George’s Street (now Nelson Street). On the upper side of the Prospect
Hill elevation are the Bank Chambers. These give the appearance of being a later
addition to the original, but as they appear on the 1869 map, if they were not part of
the building of 1861 they must have been added between this date and 1869.
In March 1891 plans were submitted for a two-storey extension to the three-storey
original building on the Great St George’s Street elevation. This provided a
Manager’s Room, Clerks’ Office and Strong Room at ground floor level, together with
a Boardroom on the first floor. The drawings submitted do not name the architect and
may have been prepared by the contractor Robert Cain of Douglas. The resulting
extension is identical in appearance to the original, being in smooth rendered stone
having lavish decorations and topped with a slate roof.
In addition to the Bank, George William Dumbell was responsible for the building of
Dumbell’s Row, the terrace of miners’ cottages in Laxey and the Jubilee Clock which
he gifted to the people of Douglas.

On Saturday 3rd February 1900, some 12 years after the death of George William
Dumbell a momentous event took place that rocked the Island to its foundations. This
date was known as Black Saturday, as it was the day that Dumbell’s Bank collapsed
leaving life for many, both rich and poor, in shambies.
The business was quickly taken over by Parr’s Bank Limited of London who paid
£40,000 for the premises and goodwill, together with £293 interest. In 1902, Parr’s
submitted plans to Douglas Corporation for alterations. These included a newly
positioned counter in a Banking Hall, enlarged by the removal of internal walls and the
staircase separating the 1891 extension from the original Bank. The Strongroom was
enlarged, the safe repositioned and the Manager’s Office relocated from the extension
to an enlarged area created from the former Waiting Room and the safe, part of which
is now an Interview Room. Also included in these plans were alterations to the toilet
accommodation and the Front Porch, which received a third step and had a new set of
outer doors closer to the street. The depth of the porch was also reduced so that it
protruded less into the Banking Hall. These plans were submitted on behalf of the
bank by William & Segar Owen Architects of Warrington and executed by Jas
Faragher of Douglas.
Alterations to the Bank in subsequent years have been mainly confined to the interior,
which has received periodic refurbishment to reflect changing banking requirements
and fashions. The building passed through the ownership of The Westminster Bank,
which merged with The National Provincial Bank and The District Bank to form
National Westminster Bank in the early 1970s.
The Banking Hall today retains what appears to be the original plasterwork and
mouldings, including arches, cornice, and decorative plaster to the ceilings. On the
upper floors, suspended ceilings and raised floors hide anything that is left of the
original building . The staircase which rises from the ground floor to the second in the
Bank Chambers is probably the original.
As the Bank was built before the advent of the Planning System and Bye Laws, there
would have been no requirement to submit plans for approval at the time of
construction. Due to this fact and the earliest photographic evidence of the premises
dating from the period 1895 - 1900, identifying any external changes to the building
before this period is not possible. However since that time, whilst some changes have
taken place, the exterior remains substantially unaltered. This is particularly true of the
ornamentation in the form of swags of fruit and flowers and the chimney stacks.
Exterior alterations include removal of the railings to the lower side of the entrance
porch, alteration to the railings to the upper side of the porch, installation of cashpoint
machine and a night safe. The crest that once stood on the pediment over the porch
has disappeared and the decorative ums that stand on the uppermost pediment at roof
level have been replaced with replicas. It is not known, however, if the initials VR and
the date of 1861 have been replaced at any point in the building’s past.

It is recommended that the National Westminster Bank Prospect Hill Douglas be
added to the Register of Protected Buildings on the following grounds:
1. High degree of external originality.
2. Forms of exterior detailing and decoration which are rare on the Island.
3. Quality of internal plasterwork and mouldings to ground floor areas.
4. Historical association of the building with an important event in the history
of the Isle of Man and a prominent citizen of the Island.
