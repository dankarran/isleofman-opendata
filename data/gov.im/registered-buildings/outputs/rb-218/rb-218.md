RIVERSIDE COTTAGE — Survey Report
Riverside Cottage which, despite its name does not have a view of the river, is situated down an un-
adopted cul-de-sac lane which has the ambiance of a very old farm access track on an alignment vastly
pre-dating the layout of most of the surrounding built development. It could be the original “Bridge
Road”. Z
The cottage is a very
typical small 2 storey
vernacular Manx stone
cottage, which over time
has become double
banked. The 1869
Ordnance Survey sheet
shows that only the
front, original part of
the cottage plus some
minimal small
outbuilding (Thie Beg?)
in the yard behind, then
existed, At that date the
curtilage was also
smaller, the site of the
present garage then
being apparently, part of
the highway! Riverside Cottage, front elevation
The cottage is land-locked by gardens owned by others on the south-east and north. There is a rather fine
decorative urn and pedestal in the front garden.
The cottage is a 3 bay, symmetrical building with a relatively large, masonry, flat roofed porch, recently
covered with corrugated plastic sheeting.. All external walls are smooth rendered, apparently over Manx
slate. The traditional timber 4 light sliding sash windows have horns. A solid outer front door leads into the
porch which has a fixed window on the east (r.h.) wall. A 4 panel half-glazed door leads into a hall slightly
wider than the facing stairs.
South-east elevation
North-west elevation

Left-hand front room ~ Sitting Room Hall & staircase
Both front rooms have thin 6 panel doors with moulded beads and architraves, Victorian "sitting-room" (
marble type fireplaces, that in the r-h. room having had its interior removed and replaced with Manx slate .
decorative walling with a small modern inset grate. In the other room the original iron grate remains inset €
with decorative brown & green glazed tiles. :
The rh. room - used
very much as THE ‘
main living/dining-
room - is somewhat
irregular in shape due
to the projecting hall
and to what has been an
over-wide opening -
now occupied by a door
and an internal window
- into the kitchen
beyond.
Ceilings may have been
open-joisted at one time ¢
but are now boarded in.
Right-hand front room — Dining Room
The kitchen is quite large and its back wall comprises part of the original plot boundary and retaining wall ¢
to the adjoining property “Claremont” and as a result is both splayed and slightly curved.
Kitchen 1 (rear wall)

Only this ceiling is open joisted, there is a former small kitchen range (“bungalow range”?) recess off-set
in the east wall. In the north-west corner a door Jeads into a long, narrow wash-house which in turn has a
back door into/the garden.
;
i
The straight, walled-in, staircase ends in a quarter-landing from which 3 sets of
3 steps rise to each room; the rearmost with another landing serving the back
bedroom and the bathroom. There is a casement window on this landing.
Right-hand front bedreom
Because of the 3 steps, each of the front bedrooms has the doorway inset
slightly and the r.h. (east) bedroom has a cot-recess over the hall and staircase
bulkhead with a second window. Both rooms have had a false-wall constructed
across their chimney-breasts and recesses.. ‘Poe original
fireplaces remain behind this studding.
Roof to back bedroom The back bedroom is lit only by a largish skylight. There is a chimney breast in
the east wall off-set to accord with the kitchen below. No sign of a fireplace. There is a plinth at eaves level.
Both back rooms have sloping ceilings following the line of the ridged roof with 2 sets exposed, vertically
set, purlins.
The bathroom has a casement window and 1950's fittings.
The modern style of construction with deep narrow sawn timbers, suggest a 1930's date for the building of
the rear part of the dwelling, utilizing in part the pre-existing stone boundary walls. The wash-house may
even be post-war but the generous use
of timber would suggest a pre timber-
rationing period for the rest.
Outside, to the west, is a small walled
garden with two pedestrian gateways to
the road.
A complicated arrangement of
garage/garden store/thie beg (with
original wooden seat-board but with a
flushing cistern!) has had their original
roof removed and replaced with a low
mono-pitch roof of translucent plastic
sheeting.

Walled garden & outbuildings

Comparison of the 1869 OS and the latest map shows
that all this structure has been sited outside the
original curtilidge on what appears to have been part
of the roadway. One wonders how title to this land
was obtained? The outside (boundary) walls are of
substantial but rough stone construction with double
doors in the end (east) wall. The internal walis and
that facing the garden are very roughly built and
generally not tied in. Floors are mainly earth. Lt is far
from new.
Outbuildings/garage from the end of the Lane
General impressions.
Looking at the front bank of building in isolation, we have here a very good example of the type of
vernacular Manx cottage which | call the full two-storey type, to differentiate from the lower, one and a half
storey equivalent (which were in general presumably earlier?) retaining many of its original features and
character. It is set on, and respects, an old road layout, now obsolete and this gives it added interest. Unlike
probably the bulk of these cottages which remain, this one has remaining unaltered, and in a town!
What alteration — mostly extensions ~- has occurred has not seriously affected the integrity of the original.
Oddities.
The way an additional bank of building has been squeezed into what was once the back yard making use of
the irregular boundary walls for two of its sides is ingenious though not especially unusual. The recessed
arrangement of the bedroom doors to accommodate access steps from the quarter landing leads one to
wonder if the staircase is perhaps a more moderate replacement for a previous, much steeper one?
Assessment.
Riverside Cottage is judged worthy of inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register as a building of
architectural and historic interest.
