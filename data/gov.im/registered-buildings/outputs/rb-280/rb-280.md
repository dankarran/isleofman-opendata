NAME: Ballagawne Gatehouse
ADDRESS: Mount Gawne Road, Port St. Mary
POST CODE: IM9 SLX
LOCAL AUTHORITY: —Rushen Parish Commissioners
GRID REF: 215 693
Introduction
The Douglas to Port Erin railway opened to the public on the 1% August 1874, one year after the
Douglas to Peel line opened.
‘Towards the end of the construction period, stringent economies were necessary to allow
completion of the line, This was particularly evident in the station buildings constructed at the
time, but it Is also apparent in the gate keeper's accommodation on the level crossings. The
Peel line level crossings had stone lodges built from the start, whereas on the Port Erin line
small wooden huts had to suffice. Several of these were later rebuilt in the form of the stone
gatehouses we see on the Port Erin line today.
The role of the gate keeper is to protect
the crossing; on the approach of the train he opens the
gates for the train and thus closes them to road users. A flag is then shown to the locomotive
driver to indicate it’s safe to proceed. After the passage of the train the gates are opened for
road users.
History
Today's surviving gatehouses at Ballalona, Ballasalla, Mill Road, The Level, Ballagawne and Four
Roads provide a good cross sectional example of the different styles of Gatehouses once seen
throughout the Isle of Man Railway Co.'s lines. Ballalona (Santon) and Mill Road (Castletown)
are good examples of the earliest form of accommodation l.e. timber construction with
corrugated iron roof, although the layout of both these huts differs. Mill Road is believed to be
the original hut at this location and dates from the line’s opening in 1874,
‘The stone gatehouses at The Level (Colby) and Four Roads (Port St.Mary) are almost Identical
and relatively unaltered since built. Four similar structures also still exist on the now closed line
to Peel; Quarterbridge, Closemoore, Crosby and Ballacraine. However these four are near
derelict, although Closemoore, Crosby and Ballacraine do still provide a very basic form of
shelter on the ‘Steam Heritage Trail’
‘The stone gatehouse at Ballasalla is similar to the ones at The Level and Four Roads, however
an extension was provided in 1962 by the Isle of Man Railway Co. to house a ‘ship's wheel’ with
which to operate the mechanical gates and observe the road.

‘The final example at Ballagawne (Port StMary) is again of stone construction, but was extended
by the Isle of Man Railway Company many years ago to provide living accommodation for the
keeper and his family.
During 2003 the Castletown to Port St.Mary section of the Douglas to Port Erin line was re-laid
a part of IRIS, the Island Sewage Project, Automation of the road crossings was part of this
project and Ballagawne was so treated with the electrical control cabinets being mounted on the
west wall. Ballagawne had ceased to provide living accommodation for the crossing keeper
many years previous and the bullding was in a poor condition prior to automation. However
since automation there has been no need to provide even basic shelter for a crossing keeper
and thus the building has been allowed to fall into a very bad state of repair. During a 2013
survey access to the extension areas was prevented due to the poor state of the wooden floor
and acro props holding-up the roof members. The original stone structure appeared relatively
sound, however inspection of the roof space was prevented due to a false ceiling.
As of the 2013 season only Ballastrang Crossing has manual gates and is permanently manned;
its staff member being provided with a basic modern hut. A bond currently exists on this
crossing preventing it from being automated; it is believed that steps are being taken to try and
lift this bond. When this bond is eventually removed and the crossing automated, another
aspect of the Isle of Man Railway will pass into history forever.
RECOMMENDATION
Ballagawne Gatehouse is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for the
following reasons;
‘Age.and Rarity
‘* Of the surviving gatehouses Ballagawne is the only example of one extended by the Isle
of Man Railway Company in order to provide living accommodation for the keeper.
However due to the extremely poor condition of the extension a considerable amount of
rebuilding work will be necessary before the building can be used again. Any
development of this building / site should be in keeping with the original structure and
the ‘Heritage Rallway Environment’,
+ Ballagawne Is a heritage landmark on today's Steam Railway.
st al a
+The original structure is stone built measuring 15°10’ in plan, 8’ tall at eves and 10'-6" at
ridge, complete with red brick edging at the windows, door and lintels, the roof is grey
slate. The layout drawing on sheet 3 helps illustrate the original stone structure and
how the Isle of Man Rallway Company extended the property to the north and east;
these extensions were rendered and the whole building white washed.
Historic Interest
* Once Ballastrang is automated, the gatehouse at Ballagawne will become a permanent
reminder of how the railway used to operate i.e. a member of staff resident in the
gatehouse with his family, spending day after day looking after and guarding the
crossing. The social history side of the railway should not be forgotten; this building's
former role helps prevent that.
