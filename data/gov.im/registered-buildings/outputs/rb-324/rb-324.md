Register entry description 
History 
The K8 was introduced in 1968 designed by Bruce Martin. It was used primarily for new sites; 
around 11000 were installed across Britain, replacing earlier models only when they needed 
relocating or had been damaged beyond repair.  
The K8 retained a red colour scheme, but it was a different shade of red: a slightly brighter 
"Poppy Red", which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks. The K8 featured a 
single large glass panel on two sides and the door.  
Details 
FORM and MATERIALS: Mark II model, post 1976. Four-sided rectangular box with a flat 
roof. Painted cast iron sections bolted together, standing on a concrete base. Single pane 
windows in door and sides.
