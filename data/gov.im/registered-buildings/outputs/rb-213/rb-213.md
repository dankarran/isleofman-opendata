Raven’s Cliff, Head Road, Douglas
Introduction
Overlooking Douglas Bay and the harbour Raven’s Cliff commands a prominent site
worthy of its claim to be one of the most prestigious Mansion Houses on the Island;
and an ‘Ideal Home’.
Architectural Interest
Designed by John Robinson the house is a very important Victorian Mansion House
and has survived, along with Harold Towers, where other properties in the area have
disappeared or been converted.
The building is weli maintained and the interiors although having been adapted by
successive owners still retain significant original features, making the house and
gardens a must for any person on the island wishing to see examples of its Victorian
Heritage.
Descriptions of the house are well documented and copies of these are included in the
research folder.
Although it is believed that some alterations to the original building have taken place,
between 1850 and 1950, there appears to be no records or plans held in the Douglas
Building Control Archives to confirm this belief. The only ‘historic’ application
discovered, despite extensive enquiries, relate to an application made by Dr. Fenton,
in 1922, to alter the ‘outbuildings’ (formerly the stables and lodges) adjacent to the
road.
However, an estate plan, prepared for an executor’s sale, was discovered in the Town
Hall Library archives and is believed to depict a plan of the house and grounds prior
to the 1890's,
Historic Interest
There are no known historic events associated with Raven’s Cliff.
Close Historic Association
The architect, John Robinson, is considered to be one of the Island’s leading and
accomplished architects and has designed a wide range of famous Manx buildings.
Raven’s Cliff was the home for many years of Rev. Fred Cubbon, a well-known and
respected philanthropist. More recently it was owned by John Morley, who died in
1999, a hugely popular former Douglas Town Councillor and Mayor.
Group Value
Raven’s Cliff is alleged to be one of the five original mansion houses built in
Douglas.

Age and Rarity
Built in 1850 it is a good example of the fashionable, and ostentatious, houses built
during that period of Douglas’s growth in popularity and wealth.
Conclusions
Raven’s Cliff is without doubt considered a notable house in Manx History and an
important Jandmark. The reputation of its architect, its links to prominent Islanders
and the quality of its impressive structure and internal arrangements makes the house
worthy of registration.
