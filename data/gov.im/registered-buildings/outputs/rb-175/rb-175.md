“VIEW PARK” or “THE MANSION”
part of the building now known as
THE MAJESTIC HOTEL,
ONCHAN,
ISLE OF MAN
Historical notes
The year 1892 saw the approval by Tynwald of the filling in of the Port-E-Vada Creek, just
behind the Derby Castle, and proposals for a coastal railway. In March 1893, two hundred
navvies constructed the electric railway to Groudle and by the 7th September, it was
completed.
The Douglas Bay Estate Company Ltd engaged Frederick Saunderson, Civil Engineer of
Athol Street, to prepare a plan for development of their land, which would be called
“Cliftonville”. The first large plot on the proposed development was sold to Mr J. S.
McAndrew: it was approximately six acres in total and occupied the field known as Creggans,
just North of Onchan Harbour. Mr McAndrew engaged the services of the young Architect
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott who had been involved in surveying the area and who was in the
process of setting up in practice in his own right, having been in the employ of Mr.
Saunderson since coming to the Island in 1889. It is important to note the standing of the
McAndrew family in the community and recognise the achievement of Scott’s securing such
a high profile commission at the relatively young age of 28 years.
The house was a very grand affair and was to be known as “View Park” and also "The
Mansion”: it was to be one of the largest private commissions which Scott undertook
anywhere in the world and this is significant bearing in mind that he designed houses and
interiors as far afield as Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Russia and America as well! as his
numerous projects in England.

In the Elizabethan Revival style, the house was faced in the distinctive, smooth, red brick
from Ruabon in Wales. The use of these bricks came into popularity Isle of Man in the
1890’s, probably due to their superior weathering capabilities: most locally produced bricks
were extremely porous. A contrast was provided in the form of carved, honey-coloured Bath
stone which was used to dress all major openings as well as providing decorative copings,
finials, quoins and other architectural features including projecting string courses and stone-
mullioned windows. The roof was clad in green Westmoreland slate and the interior was
finished in Oak and Walnut.
The site of this detached manor house in its prominent coastal location must have caused
quite a stir at the time of its completion and would be like no other on the Island at that time.
The external appearance clearly shows the influence of the much published work of Emest
George, however Scott is able to achieve a well-resolved and almost fluid plan form, whilst
creating an appearance of balanced symmetry on both the entrance and garden elevations. His
skill in handling the plan form is already very evident.
The plan of the house and proposed elevation appeared in The Building News of the 21*
April, 1893 and the house is described as being “in course of erection”. It is said that the total
cost of construction for the House, Lodge and Stables was some twenty thousand pounds
(£20,000). It would seem that J.S. McAndrew did not live to occupy the property and in the
Memorial of his Will dated the 29" June, 1899 the property is set out (inter alia) and
described as follows:
“All and Singular that Dwelling house and premises with the lodge and stable thereto
belonging called and known by the name of “View Park” situate on the Estate of Howstrake
in the Parish of Onchan and containing 7 acres 0 roods and 13.25 perches or thereabouts of
land the same being a portion of the land purchased by the said John Smith McAndrew from
Douglas Bay Estate Limited by Deed of Sale dated the 315' day ofJanuary 1893.”

Upon the death of J. S. McAndrew the property passed to his brother and Heir at Law,
Francis Glen McAndrew, who with the Widow, Mary Laura McAndrew, sold the property to
Harold Vincent Aldred of number forty two Spring Gardens, Manchester, on the 9"
September, 1896 for only £6,000.
During this part of its early life, the building had close associations with the then recently
formed Golf Club in the Howstrake area and even as early as September, the same month that
the property was changing ownership,
“a Prize Presentation was held in the large house next to the course, view Park Mansion,
now occupied by Mr. Glenn McAndrew.” (The Onchan Story by Gordon N. Kuiveton
p.49)
The new owner, Mr. Aldred was a chartered accountant of some standing, being President of
the Manchester Institute of Chartered Accountant. His company William Aldred and Sons
were also auditors to the City of Manchester and on the Island they were auditors to the Isle
of Man Tramways and Electric Power Company and the fated Dumbell Banking Company.
“Black Saturday,” 3" January, 1900 will always be remembered as being responsible for the
downfall of numerous projects and the ruin of many people on the Island. The main culprit
was held to be Mr. Alexander Bruce, Manager of the Bank, who had covered his mishandling
of financial matters by false accounting. This was not picked up by the Bank’s auditors,
William Aldred and Sons and the ultimate result was that Mr. Aldred Senior was sentenced to
six months hard labour, at the age of 74 years! Following on from this disaster, in 1900, the
building was acquired from Mr. Aldred by Rebecca Prestwich, wife of Mr.R.H. Prestwich,
Chairman of the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway who was also a large shareholder in the
Isle of Man Tramways. Mr. Prestwich also took on a lease of the Golf Course and used it as a
private facility until 1908.

Original Design and Changes
Although many plans are deposited with Onchan Village Commissioners showing how the
building has changed from time to time, the only plans which have, as yet, come to light to
indicate how the original building was designed are the aforesaid plans which were published
in The Building News of 21% April, 1893 when the building is described as being under
construction. The plan (ground floor only) takes advantage of the naturally sloping site with
all the main reception rooms being located on the Southern and Eastern elevations having
magnificent coastal views across Douglas Bay. Early, distant photographs of the building
seem to indicate that the conservatory shown in the published drawings was probably not
built. but the overall external form of the Southern, Western and Eastern elevations do not
point towards the main corpus of the building deviating markedly from the published
drawings.
As with all of Baillie Scott’s houses, the plan form is a most important feature of the design
and his handling the interrelationship of spaces and functions developed during his time on
the Island. The plan form in this building is quite fluid but more linear than in some of his
later works. however, we can see his design philosophy developing in that the Hall provides a
and welcoming central focus for the house occupying an area almost as large as the major
reception rooms, with a fireplace facing the principal staircase. This arrangement is
developed further in “Ivydene” the work which followed almost immediately after View Park.
In his own words Scott explains:
“In the old days, a large house was usually a dignified structure . It expressed a certain quiet
stateliness of planning and furnishing, and in the old English manor house one found the
straight vista of the carriage-drive leading to the square forecourt, with the front entrance of
dignified aspect. Without vulgar ostentation the whole effect was one of quiet, homely,
dignity, not rejoicing in expense for the sake of expense, but for the sake of beauty andfitness.
4

The large house will be chiefly marked by the number of its specialised rooms, which,
however, should still combine to form an ensemble focused in its central hall. It will further
be distinguished by the use of materials which are beyond the means of the occupant af the
cottage...
Houses and Gardens - M. H. Baillie Scott - First Published 1906, re-issued 1995 pp 43-44
The full history of the property during the first twenty years of this century has yet to be
uncovered: newspapers for the period have not yet been catalogued at the Manx Museum
Library and so, although we are aware of the close associations with the Golf Club, items and
or photographs reported in the press have not been unearthed. Considering the building’s
colourful history and its semi-public uses, it is highly likely that there are images and items
of information contained in personal archives which would assist in building a more complete
picture of the historical development of the building and provide further information
regarding the interior of the original building as created for the McAndrew family.
Scott developed very clear views regarding the design of “the house” and furthermore on the
design of the various elements which all combine to achieve a successful design:
Ceilings - his basic philosophy was to allow the structure to be honest and self-expressionist,
however, he does allow for a variation in approach:
“Other and more elaborate ceilings may be divided into panels with wooden ribs. In such
cases there is an obvious departure from the floor sturcture of the room above, and such
panellings should therefore not be too structural in their character...... They may most
reasonably be used in passages where it may be desirable to form the ceiling at a lower
level than the upper floor...... ” Houses and Gardens (op cit) p.p. 103 - 104
It is my contention that the deeply coved ceilings which remain in some of the rooms at first
floor , including the “Long Gallery” passage, form part of the original Baillie Scott house.
seen STREET shiteNeryinne enceare

Scott goes on to say;
“In upper rooms it is often possible to obtain an excellent effect by means of a curved,
segmented ceiling, which affords an excellent field for decoration in many ways,..... Simple
7
types of vaulting may often be used in corridors with excellent effect...” Houses and
Gardens (op cit) p 104,
This form of ceiling is clearly a forerunner of others which he was to develop later in his
career; a notable example is again found at Ivydene.
The illustration of A Stone House in his book Houses and Gardens is clearly a development
of The Mansion and in Chapter thirty one of Houses and Gardens (op cit), Scott describes
in considerable detail the siting, approach to and gardens of a house which, although un-
named, bears an uncanny similarity to The Mansion. Save for his chapter on the design of the
semi-detached house, where Myrtle Bank and Holly Bank in Little Switzerland are
discernible, it is interesting to note that Scott does not specifically illustrate any of his houses
on the Island by name. Why this should be, we can only guess at; possibly, having moved
away from the Island, it proved to be difficult to obtain photographic and other material in
order to illustrate the designs. The inclusion of A Stone House does, I would suggest, give
more weight to its standing within Scott’s personal perception and the value of the group of
Island buildings is being increasingly acknowledged.
Two complete tiled hearths have been uncovered during our initial investigations (others may
exist): Scott tended to favour natural colour tones and combinations:
“generally the central green tone af the spectrum is the most satisfactory with the
introduction of its adjacent tints of either blue or yellow..” Houses and Gardens
p.88.


Reference has been made to J. D. Kornwolf’s comprehensive book on the work of Baillie
Scott. This book is a wide-ranging study of Scott’s work and publications, but it should be
noted that some discrepancies have from time to time been reported in the factual information
contained in the monograph. I wonder if the extended and rendered appearance of the building
was sufficient to deter Mr. Kornwolf from looking at the original building in any detail.
One clear advantage of retaining the original building on the site would be its influence
upon the quality of design of further development which might be permitted on the site.
The site taken as a whole would certainly benefit from a programme of redevelopment: any
proposal would have to respond to the character and quality of the original Mansion which
would, in fact, set the standard of any future development as well as adding an element of
prestige to the site.
This building was also for many years the Island's top hotel and as such has played a most
important part in the development of tourism in the Island: finding a future use for the
original building will also be a key to its revitalisation. Its Registration is intended to act asa
catalyst for progressing the redevelopment of this important landmark site .
A final note upon the Gate house and Stable block: these have over the years been altered but
still remain inside the security boarding and extensions. The buildings give a taste of the
architectural treatment of the main house and also would be capable of restoration. The roof
vent to the Stable block is a well known feature in the area and is characteristic of the
distinctive developing style of the Architect.

The entry in to the Protected Buildings Register of the original corpus of “View Park”
also Known as “The Mansion House” together with the Gate House and Stable Block,
the perimeter walls and gates, is confirmed upon the following grounds;-
1. The building(plus out offices and premises) constitutes the first major work of the
internationally reputed Architect M.H. Baillie Scott; it is the only known work executed by
him in this particular style and provides unique evidence of his early and developing
design skills.
2. The building has played an important role in the sociological and historical development of
the Village District of Onchan and in the wider context of the Island as a whole.
3. The prominence of the building in its coastal position makes a_ significant
contribution to the landscape of the Isle of Man and this has lead to the building becoming
a well known landmark.

Appeal No: 1161
Planning Application No: RB 175r
Appeal by Capt. T K Crellin and others against the decision of the Planning
Committee to delete the Majestic Hotel (parts) from the Register of Protected
Buildings
Preliminaries
1. A list of the appellants, other objectors and others appearing at the inquiry is
annexed to this report.
2. At the opening of the inquiry, the death was announced of Mr Brian Hyslop, one
of the appellants. The inquiry expressed its sincerest condolences to Mrs Hyslop.
3. The inquiry received an unusual amount of technical and professional evidence,
most of which is contained in the inquiry documents, and much of which was not
challenged during the inquiry. Reference was also made to published works by
and about the architect of the registered building, Mr Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Lists of all the inquiry documents, the publications referred to, plans and
photographs are annexed to this report (Annex B). Accordingly, this report details
the technical evidence only where it is particularly contentious or otherwise
necessary to assess the merits of the cases.
4. The main exception to the technical evidence being well documented is that of Mrs
Diane Haigh, who was called by the Advisory Council on Planning and the
Environment without notice and contrary to the Rules of Procedure. Whilst one
course of action would have been not to hear Mrs Haigh, it seemed to me that it
would not have been in the public interest to fail to hear the evidence of one of the
leading authorities on Baillie Scott. Her oral evidence is summarised in Annex A
of this report. The Advisory Council on Planning and the Environment were
admonished as to compliance with the Rules.
5, This report now continues with brief summaries concerning Baillie Scott and the
Isle of Man, the history of the building in question and the events leading to the
appeals, before going on to the gist of the parties’ cases in the normal way.
Baillie Scott and the Isle of Man
6. Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott was born near Ramsgate in 1865 into a well-to-do
Scottish landed family. After some hesitation as to choice of career, he entered
articles with Major Charles E Davis, the City Architect of Bath. There he met and
married his wife Florence, coming to the Island for their honeymoon. Remaining
on the Island, he took employment with an engineer and surveyor in Douglas, Mr
Frederick Saunderson, whose work in hand included the laying out of the Douglas
Bay (Howstrake) Estate, He was with Saunderson from 1889 to 1893, living at
35 Alexander Terrace, Douglas. Whilst with Saunderson he produced a number of
designs, executed and not executed, including in 1892 the still extant cemetery
office at Braddan.
7. In 1892-1893 he built his own house in Douglas, “the Red House”, and in 1893 set
up in practice on his own, being the architect for the appeal premises and a number
of other buildings: Ivydene, Little Switzerland, Douglas (1893-4); farm buildings
and house at Bishopscourt (1893-4); Oakleigh, Glencrutchery Road Douglas

(1893-4) (now demolished); Holly Bank and Myrtle Bank, Victoria Road Douglas
(1895-6); Leafield and Braeside, King Edward Road Onchan (1896-7);
Glencrutchery House interiors (1897-8) (dismantled); Terrace houses in Falcon
Cliff Terrace, Douglas (1897-8); the Village Hall, Onchan (1897-8) and
Castletown Police Station (1900). It has also been suggested that the Groudle
Glen Hotel is his work (Slater 1995, p.22). He was associated with local artists,
Archibald Knox and David Robinson, and he painted and designed interior fittings
and furniture. He published and exhibited widely.
Increasingly during his time on the Island he obtained commissions in England,
Scotland and on the continent of Europe. In 1901,with his reputation spreading
through Britain and the Continent, he left, moving to Bedford. In 1919, working
prolificly and with a still growing world-wide reputation, he moved his office to
London, in partnership as Baillie Scott and Beresford. He ceased practising in
1939 and died in 1945. (Chronologies of the life and works of Baillie Scott are in
Kornwolf 1972 and Haigh 1995),
Following in the footsteps of William Morris (1834-1896) and Richard Norman
Shaw (1831-1912), Baillie Scott was one of the leading lights of the Arts and
Crafts Movement, alongside such well known architects as C F A Voysey (1857-
1941) and Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928). He later became involved
with the Garden City movement, designing for Hampstead Garden Suburb and
Letchworth. He is known principally for his domestic commissions rather than for
major public buildings, and much of his house design was copied, at least
superficially, by others.
In 1995, the work of Baillie Scott was the subject of an exhibition in Douglas
sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain and Manx National Heritage.
The history of the building
The appeal premises stand on a site of some 2.4 ha (6 acres) between King
Edward Road and the cliff top footpath around Onchan Head. They were
designed and constructed between 1892 and 1893 for a Lancashire industrialist,
Mr J S MacAndrew (Haigh 1995), being the first house to be erected in the
development of the Howstrake Estate following the filling in of Port-e-Vada Creek
and the beginning of the construction of the Douglas and Laxey Electric Tramway
(Document 4 and Additional Photo 1). The premises were then known variously
as “View Park” or “the Mansion”.
The house experienced a number of vicissitudes, and by 1920 had become an
hotel. As such, it was altered and extended at various times between 1920 and
1970, As built, the exterior walls were of red Ruabon brick with Bath stone (or
similar) quoins, mullions and other features. At some time after 1920, the walls
and almost all these features were cement rendered and painted white. The
original appearance of the house, and its appearance following various stages of
alteration and extension can be seen in the drawings at Plans H and I. Its
appearance whilst the hotel was a going concern can be seen from the photograph
in Additional Document 4. The hotel closed as such in or about 1987, since when
the only use appears to have been the use as auction rooms in part of the west end.

The events leading to the appeals
On 4 March 1998 the Department served a Building Preservation Notice
(No.01/98) indicating that part of the former Majestic Hotel, together with the
lodge and stables, appeared to the Department to be of special architectural or
historic interest, and that these buildings were being considered for entering in the
Protected Buildings Register (Document 2).
The Department also gave public notice under the Registered Building
Regulations 1991, of its proposal to enter the buildings in the Register, inviting
representations thereon, The Department received representations from Manx
National Heritage, Onchan District Commissioners, the Advisory Council on
Planning and the Environment and several special interest groups. Representations
were also received from local residents, from one local MHK and from the
prospective developers of the site, Heritage Homes Ltd (now the owners). Most
of those making representations supported Registration, the exceptions being
Heritage Homes Ltd and the Onchan District Commissioners who indicated
support for demolition and redevelopment.
On the 5 June 1998, the Planning Committee, after considering these
representations and other material information contained in a report by the
Department’s Conservation Officer (Documents 4-9), Registered the buildings. (A
copy of the notice and supporting information are at Document 1 and
Document 3).
On 22 June 1998, Heritage Homes Ltd requested de-registration of the buildings,
providing the Planning Committee with written evidence of a conservation
specialist, Dr R Wools (Documents 10-13), Then on 7 August 1998, the
Department invited representations on de-Registration. The Department received
objections and other representations from similar sources and of a similar nature to
those received in response to its notice of March.
After considering the evidence of Dr Wools and the representations received, and
after inspecting both the exterior and interior of the buildings, the Planning
Committee decided to de-Register the buildings on 17 September 1998
(Document 14).
The case for the appellants
the material points are:
The appellants, mostly local residents include (or at least have the support of) a
writer on the life and work of Baillie Scott, Mr Gregory J Slater (Slater 1995).
It is important that the issue be seen in terms of the importance of the appeal
premises to the Island rather than in wider UK or European terms. For over forty
years a succession of attractive buildings, and sometimes entire blocks have been
aliowed by their owners to degenerate into such a poor condition that demolition
was eventually permitted almost without protest. This pattern appears to be
repeated in the case of the appeal premises, a building of not only historical

interest but uniquely, in Manx terms, placed on a prominent natural headland,
framing the curve of Douglas Bay. Disregarding the ugly modern additions, which
can be removed, the original house is an attractive and interesting feature,
especially when seen from seaward — a vista which is open to around five
hundred people every day when passing on the ferry, some of them enjoying their
first view of the Island.
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott was one of the most important architects to have any
connection with the Island, and so it is important that his work should be properly
recognised. The appeal premises were not only one of Baillie Scott’s earliest
works, his commission to build them was one of the largest private commissions
which he undertook anywhere in the world,
The effect of Registration is essentially to put a brake on demolition so that careful
thought can be given to the future of the building concerned. In this respect, the
condition of a building is not material. Even so, the poor condition of the appeal
premises is exaggerated in the respondent applicant’s written evidence. For
example, despite the evidence of water penetration almost everywhere, there is, as
the respondent’s oral evidence accepts, no actual evidence of the presence of dry
rot in the building. This condition is all too often used as a scare: it can in any
case be treated by modern methods. Nor, having regard to the hardness and
impermeability of Ruabon brick, is it likely that much brickwork would have to be
replaced, merely carefully re-pointed after removal of the cement render. There
certainly would be no need to render it again.
The basic structure and shape of the original building survives, together with such
key features as the original front door. Also surviving is the original grand drive
into the building and the steps leading to it, marking the relationship of the
building to its grounds. The loss of exterior features does not change the external
character of a building nor its presence in the environment.
Once a building is demolished, it is lost forever, and any study that might be made
of it, for example to ascertain its original interior features or details of
construction, becomes impossible. In this case, the appeal premises could be
temporarily made safe and so retained, even if the modern extensions were pulled
down, Then consideration could be given to what might become of them.
Restoration of the end walls and the making good of the whole building is not too
much of a challenge.
Retention of what is left of the original building could, on its restoration, not only
help to counter the unfavourable impression given by the ugly white scar of the
nearby White City flats which disfigure the next headland, but would also provide
an attraction for a future development of the site. Even when buildings of historic
or architectural interest have been accidentally destroyed, it has still sometimes
been worthwhile building a replica, as the examples of the National Trust property
Uppark and some of the world-famous temples and shrines in Japan, such as the
Kinkaju-Ji Temple in Kyoto, show. Recently, a house has been built from original
plans by Baillie Scott’s contemporary, Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
Future generations will condemn us for what we have already done to the Island’s
Victorian heritage, and will certainly not forgive us for hastily destroying all
evidence of Scott's largest Manx undertaking. That heritage is not only of value in

itself, it also is good for the tourist trade. It may well be that the interior is
irretrievable and the shell in poor repair, but many other such buildings have been
rescued, and it is essential, as a first step, that this one remains on the Register.
The case for the Advisory Council on Planning and the Environment
the material points are:
As the Planning Committee misdirected itself in reversing its earlier decision to
Register the appeal premises, their decision was a bad one and so the original
decision should now be reinstated.
In deciding to register the Majestic Hotel, the Planning Committee had before
them the report of the Department’s Conservation Officer (Document 4) which
recommended registration of the original corpus of the Mansion House together
with the gate house, stable block, perimeter walls and gates for the following
reasons:
The building is one of the first major works of the internationally reputed
Architect M.H. Baillie Scott and is the only known work executed by him
in this particular style.
The building has played an important role in the sociological and historical
development of the Village District of Onchan and in the wider context of
the Island as a whole.
The prominence of the building in its coastal position makes a significant
contribution to the landscape of the Isle of Man and this has lead to the
building becoming a well known landmark.
All these points are supported by the evidence of a leading authority on the work
of Baillie Scott, Mrs Diane Haigh, whose evidence is summarised in Annex A.
In her opinion, the question before the inquiry is — is this building of sufficient
importance to be protected? Her answer is —yes, for two reasons, (a) the
position of “the Mansion” in the work of Baillie Scott, and () its wider
significance to the Isle of Man.
After reviewing the origins of the building and its architectural character, Mrs
Haigh concludes that the appeal premises may be seen, not as an early work of
little consequence, but as the first chapter of a long book of character leading
through “the Red House” to “Blackwell” (a large recently restored Baillie Scott
house in what used to be Westmorland) and Baillie Scott’s later work.
Study of the Arts and Crafts Movement shows Baillie Scott to be firmly in its first
division, and rightly the subject to international acclaim in his day and becoming
increasingly appreciated once again in our own. Yet little of his work is derivative,
always he imposed his own stamp on whatever was designed. In the course of his
career on the Island and his association with the Island’s artists such as Archibald
Knox he turned his back on designing to recognised “styles”, seeking inspiration
rather in the roots of vernacular culture, at the “old work” executed by craftsmen
before the machine age. Here, on the Island, he learned the value of variation in
the textures of materials rather than in applied decoration.

As to the significance of the appeal premises in this history, English Heritage has
published a guide for prospective bidders for Lottery funding for building
restoration, “Conservation Plans for Historic Places”. Whilst not in itself UK
Government policy, it helps prospective bidders assess and present the importance
of the buildings concerned. It urges that not only should the architectural history
or design merit be taken into account, but also a building’s cultural significance, its
value to the community, to education, its townscape character, and its association
with historic events. The evidence points to merit under most of these heads, but
chiefly as to its contribution to architectural history, the history and culture of the
Island at the turn of the century and to the buildings importance in the landscape.

In short, the appeal premises contribute greatly to the group of buildings of which
they form a part, that is the group of Baillie Scott buildings on the island generally
and in Onchan in particular, where three other examples of his work is to be found.
The purpose of Mrs Haigh’s research on the Island was to secure photographic
and other material for the exhibition and the accompanying book (Haigh 1995). It
was not to make a compendium of Baillie Scott’s work. That had already been
done by Kornwolf. In all, Baillie Scott designed over 200 houses, of which it was
possible only to photograph some two dozen in preparing for the exhibition and
the book.
The appeal premises represent the cradle of Baillie Scott’s career and the entrance
to his subsequent work, Both the differences from his later work and the
likenesses mark it out as interest.
As the Planning Committee accept in evidence, nothing changed between the
initial decision to Register and the Planning Committee’s agreement to de-
Register, except, irrationally, the opinion of the Committee. In considering the
report submitted by the respondent applicants (Document 12) and visiting the
premises without seeking the either advice of their Conservation Officer, or, as the
1991 Act requires, the Advisory Council, the Planning Committee failed in their
statutory duty. The reasons given for their decision (Document 14) are, moreover,
defective.
Although much is made of the absence of many of the original interior features,
the Registration (Document 1) did not in fact make reference to them.
Whilst most of the original end walls have been replaced in the course of the
building’s extension and alteration, it is not necessary to rebuild them to secure
what is left of the original structure. So much of the extension as is necessary to
hold up the remaining original structure could be retained, or it could be propped
up pending its incorporation into a suitable designed new building, just as the spire

of St Andrew’s United Reformed Church in Douglas was incorporated into a
modern office block.
Evidence continues to arrive as to the original appearance of the appeal premises,
as the recent acquisition of photographs relating to the construction of the
Douglas and Laxey Electric Tramway shows (Additional Photo 1).
It is not the case that the walls were rendered to make them weatherproof. Bath
stone, whilst geologically alien to the Island, is nonetheless widely used such as in
the Tynwald building and Douglas Town Hall, whilst Ruabon brick is particularly
dense and weatherproof.
Registration does not require the rebuilding of the whole original structure as first
erected, only the retention of what remains today.
If the main building were not to be Registered, there would be little resistance to
the de-Registration of the stable block and lodge would be little resisted. Both are
much altered; the two buildings being bridged together in alterations executed in
1932. The principal feature of interest is a rather ornate ventilator on the roof.
The case for Manx National Heritage
the material points are:
Bearing in mind both the history of the appeal premises and the local and
international reputation and importance of their architect Hugh Mackay Baillie
Scott, it is clear that the appeal premises are of considerable architectural merit,
and are in a key location. Their de-Registration, allowing their demolition and
replacement by another building, would be a retrograde step and would
enormously detract from the potential visual amenity of the area, as well as
robbing the Island — and the world — of Baillie Scott’s earliest major work and
one of his most important achievements.
The criteria for Registration should not only be those of the former UK.
Department of the Environment’s PPG 15, but a building’s local importance
should also be considered.
It is not necessary to remove all accretions to what remains of the original
structure, nor to create a pastiche of the original. Buildings change over time, and
what is added and taken away is all part of a building’s history. That existing
structure could be rescued from within its later additions is shown by the work of
its owners. the Dandara Group, to the quality restoration of the former Falcon
Cliff Hotel and the former Grand Hotel.
Once the building has gone, it is gone.
The case for the Planning Committee
the material points are:
Registration of a building implies much more than putting down a marker so that
consideration may be give to the future of a building. There is a very strong
presumption in policy and practice that a Registered building should be preserved.
The fundamental question to be addressed in the Registration or de-Registration of
a building is whether it has architectural or historic interest. Questions such as

whether structures should be retained or how they might be reconstructed or
adapted for future use are essentially matters for other proceedings under the Act:
and Regulations, and are not relevant considerations at the present.stage.
Although the original Baillie Scott house was of considerable architectural interest ..
(see report and proof of evidence of Mrs Hendy, Document 4 and Document 35) .
little of this interest remains to the present day.
In the interior the existing building, the radical alteration of much of the original
interior layout has severely diminished the interest of the building. . This is an
important consideration as one of Baillie Scott’s principal contributions to building
design was the design of interiors. Moreover, the absence of many original details
and finishes inside and outside is of such an order as to have changed markedly the -
building’s original character. Both end walls of the original building have been.
removed and would need re-constructing. -
If the building had not been so altered over the years but had remained in .
something of its original condition, it would undoubtedly be worth registration and -
retention. Unfortunately this is not the case. In general, so little of the original
integrity of the building remains to be the subject of preservation and restoration:
that the final result of such works would be the reconstruction and recreation of a
replica of the original house rather than refurbishment of the original. .
The case for the respondent applicants, Heritage Homes, Ltd.
the material points are:
This appeal should be concerned solely as to whether the appeal premises have
sufficient architectural merit to be registered. That merit cannot embrace the
social value of the appeal premises, nor their landscape value as a landmark. In
any event, the premises would become much less of a landmark if the white
rendering was removed and the red stonework revealed,
It is not a question of whether the Planning Committee’s decision was taken
correctly or not. Otherwise different criteria would apply to a building’s de-
Registration as to its Registration.
It is significant that whilst the Planning Committee initially were in favour of
Registration it was their visit to the building which caused them to change their
mind at the review, because on that visit the applicant’s technical evidence
(Documents 12, 13, 39and 49) was fully supported by the visible facts.
Whilst it is accepted that the question of whether the building is worthy of
registration must be seen in the context of the cultural and architectural heritage of
the Isle of Man, it would be very odd if the principles for registration differed
radically from those which apply in England and other parts of the United
Kingdom. PPG 15 may therefore point towards the correct approach. In .
particular the registration process in respect of a building of this age should be
concerned only with buildings which remain substantially in their original form
(Document 48; PPG 15, paragraph 6.11). This view appears to have been
accepted by the Department in Registering “the Red House”. In this case it was
said that it was “of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie Scott

64.
designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their original form
should be entered into the .. . Register”.
Three aspects which should be considered in this case — the intrinsic architectural
quality of the building style, the significance of the association with Baillie Scott,
and the extent to which the alteration of the building has so affected the value of
the building that registration is no longer appropriate. Historical interest and
associations other than the connection with Baillie Scott are unremarkable and not
sufficient to justify registration.
Architectural Quality
Whether this building is described as Elizabethan Revival style or Jacobean
Revival style it is a typical late Victorian building without any particular intrinsic
merit. Without the connection with Baillie Scott it would not even be considered
for Registration.
The architect’s choice of materials does not seem to have been wise. Porous Bath
stone in this exposed coastal location does not seem to have been appropriate. It
may be noted that in “Houses and Gardens” the architect refers to the Stone
House being built “in a stone district”, presumably suggesting that local, not
imported, stone would be used in such a design.
The evidence does not therefore suggest any intrinsic quality worthy of
Registration. Being selective in the choice of buildings of this age for listing or
registration is important so as not to devalue the significance of the list as awhole.
Association with Baillie Scott
There is no doubting the local interest in the Isle of Man in Baillie Scott.
However, this does not mean that every work on the Island which still exists has to
be preserved, A considerable number of the buildings Baillie Scott designed
during his time on the Island survive, in many cases relatively unaltered, and are
protected by Registration. In terms of rarity of examples of his work, therefore,
no special case can be made,
The appeal premises are not representative of his style or development in such a
way as to justify preservation. There are other properties locally in that category
which are registered. Nor are the appeal premises instructive as to variation from
his normal style.
Nor can the building be said to have significance as being the first of his works,
although that criterion is a doubtful basis for distinguishing a building. Generally,
first works are unlikely to have the merit of those carried out by the mature
architect.. His very first surviving appears to have been the cemetery office at
Braddan (Slater 1995). whilst his “first major work”, according to Haigh (1995,
p.15) was his own “Red House”.
This atypical building carries no particular interest either as an aberration from the
architect’s style or as showing some crucial stage in his development. There is
nothing externally to suggest that it exhibits features which were to become his
trademark or to show any real transition in his development. Rather it appears to
bear the influence of Ernest George. Even allowing some connection with “the

66,
67.
68.
69,
Stone House” in “Houses and Gardens” (Baillie Scott 1906) it does not appear to
have been a style which he ever repeated. “Blackwell” is a much more important
building and in a very different style. Externally, therefore, it is difficult to identify
features which could be said to distinguish this building as one designed by Baillie
Scott - even disregarding the alterations. Any value which it might have externally
is as an aberration which was not repeated.
Internally, the “fluidity” evident in other and later other works does not seem to be
so apparent, - although it is now difficult to appreciate the effect of the original
building because of the extent of alteration,
That the design of the appeal premises had little importance in the eyes of the
architect himself can be seen from the design of the “Stone House” in “Houses and
Gardens” being materially different from that of the appeal premises. Further
evidence of the lack of importance of the appeal premises in the career of Baillie
Scott is that they merit only a marginal note in Mrs Haigh’s book (Haigh 1995)
and she did not consider it worth while even visiting the premises to photograph
them during her research visit to the Island. As is accepted in the Conservation
Officer’s evidence, the premises were deliberately omitted as a matter of priorities
from Registration at the 1995/6 review when Baillie Scott’s principal works were
included on the Register.
Degree of alteration
Justification for registration completely disappears in the degree of alteration that
the premises have suffered. This has been described as “cruelly altered” (Kornwolf
1972) or “horrendously disfigured” (Slater 1995). As to repairing the harm done,
it must be remembered that one of the major problems with any restoration project
would be the uncertainties over the original design which arise from the lack of full
plans detailing certain critical aspects of the design. The likelihood of further
photographic evidence coming forward is slim. The later additions have no
architectural merit and completely alter whatever value the original design might
have had. Whilst they could physically be removed, albeit at some risk to the
integrity of the structure, the question arises as to what would be put in their
place. There is now no clear idea as to what one of the elevations may have
looked like. Both the eastern and western elevations would have to be completely
re-built. The two porches, if replaced, would also be to conjectural designs, and
parts of the original building have already been !ost in their entirety.
There are at present three options as to what might become of the appeal
premises. The first is removal of the later additions and their replacement by a
modern approximation of what might have been part of the original architect’s
design.
On this option, the render covering all of the remaining walls and most of the
stonework could be replaced, in which case one of the most striking features of the
original design (the contrast between brick and stone) would be lost, or it could be
removed. But if it were to be removed and the original stonework renewed then
the same weathering problems which led to the rendering would be likely to re~
occur. Renewal of the stonework and necessary brickwork would again mean that

key parts of the original building would be replaced by modern construction. This
could be as high as 100% of the external stonework of the building.
One of the key features of Baillie Scott's work was to design a building where the
open space of the garden interrelated with the enclosed space of the building. That
relationship has been lost and could not be repaired so long as any other part of
the site were to be developed, a situation which both the Planning Committee and
the appellants accept in evidence as inevitable. The construction of the swimming
pool completely altered the contours of the surrounding grounds.
The restoration of most of the interior would be entirely hypothetical. There is
little or no idea as to how the upper floor was laid out. The ground floor may or
may not have been laid out in accordance with the plans published in 1893. The
internal decorative elements which were again very much part of the quality of
Baillie Scott as an architect are unknown and would have to be almost entirely re-
created, again conjecturally.
The second option on demolishing the extensions would be to prop up the remains
of the original or in some way to “mothball” them. They could not be left as they
were. This would be a difficult operation of doubtful value.
The third option would be to build new extensions, only more sympathetically than
those existing. Effectively, this would still create a replica, though not an
authentic one.
Summary
Registration of appeal premises would not result in the preservation of a fine
example of an important architect’s work, Ifthe cost of renovation and repair
between £1 million and £1.5 million (Document 6 and Document 13) could ever be
justified, and if the structure of the remainder of the house could survive this
further alteration, what would be left would be a building which would be very
largely a modern re-construction, which could only in part be confidently asserted
to resemble the original externally and which internally would be almost entirely a
modern approximation of how the original might have looked.
The approach of the Planning Committee was correct. The appeal premises do
not require to be registered and the interest which remains in what is left of, and
known of the plan form, could satisfactorily be addressed by recording the
remaining features prior to any future demolition.
The respondent applicants, as present owners of the appeal premises and in
response to the request of the Planning Committee, undertake, in the event of their
being allowed to demolish them, to allow the recording of the existing fabric, the
salvage of architecturally interesting elements, and to construct at their expense a
model of the original building so far as its design can be ascertained.
Conclusions
Bearing in mind the current wave of interest in the Arts and Crafts movement, the
wealth of evidence at this inquiry and such as I have seen of the literature on the
subject, I have no doubt of the status of Baillie Scott as an architect of
at

international importance and of particular importance in the architectural history of
the Island.
In tracing the professional career of Baillie Scott, it is clear to my mind that the
appeal premises have an important place. They were not his first work; that
distinction seems to go to Braddan. Nor were they his first major design; that
probably goes to the “Red House”. But the house for Mr MacAndrew was
undoubtedly his first major commission, and from what one can now see of its
original appearance it was a design of distinction. Why it should have been so
different in concept from his own “Red House” must remain a matter of academic
speculation. My own guess, for what it is worth, is that the obviously ambitious
young architect did not wish to alienate his first client of substance with as yet
untried ideas.
None of the materials used in the facades of the building are indigenous, but then
the Island is not blessed with much stone suitable for high class work. Red
Ruabon brick in my experience is ideal for an exposed situation while Bath stone,
though notoriously porous, is not unknown on the Island and at least in this
exposed location is probably not much subject to sulphate attack.
Were then the appeal premises to be in anything like their original condition, I
would expect no hesitation in their Registration as a building of special
architectural or historic interest. However, they are not in anything like their
original condition. The basic outline of the original building survives, and is a
prominent feature however and from wherever one looks at it. Iam not too
concerned with the loss of the original end walls, as the interest seems to have
been almost wholly in the north and south elevations, But most of the interior is
lost, and the original materials and detailing of the exterior are shrouded in cement
render. Under the render, the brickwork is not to my mind in too bad a condition,
though obviously in need of pointing, when what remains of the nails used to
provide a key to the render can be readily removed. However, many of the
original windows and their openings have been “modernised” whilst the stonework
of the others has decayed beyond repair. In other respects the stonework features
are in bad shape. The southern doorway feature has disappeared altogether.
Within the building, the original layout now seems indistinguishable, whilst most
but not all of the interior features have disappeared. The general condition of the
building is as one would expect in a building that has been virtually abandoned for
over ten years, but it should not be exaggerated.
I would not rule landmark value out of the criteria for assessing special
architectural or historic interest. Architectural appraisal necessarily includes
reference to a building’s siting.
This inquiry was not into the quality of the Planning Committee’s administration
of the issues involved, on which I make no comment, still less into its legality, but
rather into the substance of the issues and only that substance.
Nor do I see no good reason to go down the road, as the Planning Committee and
the respondent applicants have, of exploring what might become of the appeal
premises were they to be retained. The issue in the present proceedings to my
mind is simply to address the questions implicit in the 1991 Act at s.1 (1); whether
12

85.
86.
87.
88.
89.

the appeal premises — as they stand, not what they were or what they might be —
are of special architectural or historic interest. The Act at s.1 (2) also adds criteria
related to the contribution of the exterior to the architectural or historic interest of
any group of buildings of which it forms part, and the desirability of preserving
features the building or structures fixed to it. Again it is the premises as they stand
that matters, what they were or what they might be.
In addressing this question I have some difficulty in counting as “group value” a
group comprising a corpus of an architect’s work in a broadly defined place. The
plain and ordinary meaning of the term is a visible, physical group on the ground.
But even if] were to use the more eccentric interpretation, it would do no more
than restate the already acknowledged importance of the building in the its
architect’s “Isle of Man period”.
I must conclude, having ruled out such escape routes from such a conclusion, that
the consideration of the special architectural or historic interest inherent in the
appeal premises as they stand is necessarily a matter of subjective judgement. If
the evidence of the Planning Committee is right, that Registration confers a strong
presumption against demolition, then that judgement should not be exercised
lightly.
On this basis, it is my own subjective judgement that what is left of this once fine
building is of landmark value, but little else. It is not of such special architectural
or historic interest as to warrant continued Registration.
I concur that the stable block and other ancillaries to the main building in the
appeal premises should not be distinguished from the decision on the whole.
The respondent applicant’s promises as to recording, salvage and the making of a
model should be welcomed.
Recommendation
I recommend that the appeal be dismissed for the reasons given above with the
effect that the Majestic Hotel be removed from the Register.

achievements are her part in researching and organising the 1995 exhibition of Baillie
Scott's work (paragraph 10 of the main report) her book on the subject (Haigh 1995) and
her restoration of one of Baillie Scott’s principal buildings, Blackwell in Westmoreland
(Additional Document 3).
1. Inher opinion, the question before the inquiry is — is this building of sufficient
importance to be protected? The answer is —yes, for two reasons, (a) the position of “the
Mansion” in the work of Baillie Scott, and (6) its wider significance to the Isle of Man.
2. As to (a) the position of “the Mansion” in the work of Baillie Scott, he was attracted
to the Island by the prospect of work. In the 1880’s Douglas was a flourishing port, and the
town was rapidly expanding. There was particular promise in connection with the
development of Onchan by Frederick Saunderson, and the commission to build “the
Mansion” by Mr MacAndrew came in about 1891or 1892 whilst he was working for
Saunderson. He was then only 28 years of age, and had not before designed such a large
building. For inspiration on this commission, he looked to the work of established architects
such Ernest George (1839-1922) and George Devey (1820-1886). (Sir Emest George was
the architect of such large country houses as Rousdon in Devon for the biscuit magnate Sir
H W Peek (1874), or Buchan Hall in Sussex for the ostrich feather importer P Saillard
(1882-5). Like “the Mansion”, Buchan Hall was executed in yellow stone and red brick.
George Devey had numerous commissions including at Betteshanger in Kent (1856-1886),
which included not only work on the imposing hall itself but also the design of modest
cottages).
3. Yet in emulating these establishment figures, he added ideas of his own, such as a long
continuous ridge and projecting gables, such as are to be seen at the Baillie Scott house in
Westmorland, “Blackwell”. He also began to develop his ideas for the use of internal space,
such as the entrance from the front into a large hall. This concept was later to be developed
into a central open space, providing a focus for family life and entertainment, and extending
into the first floor, with flexible arrangements of private spaces opening off it; “fluidity” in
the use of space as Baillie Scott himself described it. In plan of “the Mansion” dining room
and the billiard room open off the hall, with the drawing room linked to it by a passage. The
dining room and the drawing room each occupy one of the apparently symmetrical
projecting gables on the sea side of the house. The passage to the drawing room also leads
to a library and the owners’ sleeping accommodation, providing also vistas through the
house, possibly also into the library at the end through a glazed door. Kitchens and other
domestic offices are to be found at the other, east, end of the house, This arrangement is to
be found also at Blackwell. A conservatory in the south west corner of the house was
designed, but probably not built. (A ground floor plan, reproduced in Kornwolf 1972 at
p.96 from “The Building News” of 21 April 1893, forms the basis of Plan C and Plan D).
4. “The Mansion” therefore may be seen, not as an early work of little consequence, but
as the first chapter of a long book of character leading through “the Red House” to
“Blackwell” and Baillie Scott’s later work.
5. The Mansion” also (b) has wider significance to the Island. Baillie Scott was a great
friend of Archibald Knox, an artist who took a great interest in the historic culture of the Isle

Planning Application No: RB 175r
of Man at a time when the development of archaeology on the Island was revealing much
about its Celtic heritage. Knox himself wrote a thesis on the Celtic crosses of the Island.
With Baillie Scott and others in their group he exhibited at the Arts Society, whilst Mrs
Baillie Scott embroidered a fire screen, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
6. Baillie Scott left the Island in 1901 largely because the supply of local clients dried up
in the depression caused by the failure of Dumbell’s Bank in 1900. It was some time before
his supply of work picked up after he moved to Bedford.
7. Nevertheless, his work undoubtedly received international recognition at this time.
The German Government sent the architect Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927) to observe the
architecture of the British Isles, and in his 3-volume work of 1904, “Das Englische Haus”,
he made much of the work of Baillie Scott. Indeed, it was on the recommendation of
Muthesius in 1897, whilst Baillie Scott was still working on the Island, that he received a
commission from the Grand Duke of Hesse to build a palace at Darmstadt (destroyed by the
RAF, 1939-45),
8. In 1906, Baillie Scott published “Houses and Gardens”, illustrating his ideas on “the
artistic house for a householder of moderate means” by drawings, water colour sketches and
photographs of houses , some built, others hypothetical. In “Houses and Gardens”, Baillie
Scott makes a plea for small houses to be built not in mean terraces but according to a
spacious plan with well designed gardens. Unlike his contemporary Sir Edwin Lutyens
(Castle Drogo Devon, New Delhi, etc.) Baillie Scott was a designer of small houses,
including such as “£200 cottages”. All the designs in which the layout is featured in “Houses
and Gardens” have at their core an open hall, with flexible spaces for various family
activities opening out of it. The hall generally rises into the upper floor, from which
activities in the hall can be observed from a gallery. This is ultimately the origin of the
modern “open plan”.
9. The sketch illustrating “a Stone House” in “Houses and Gardens” pp.287f, is probably
not an illustration of the appeal premises, though it bears some relationship to it in its
general form and layout. Many of Baillie Scott’s earlier designs for houses, even those
which he probably regarded as important such as “the Red House” are omitted from this
book.
10. “Houses and Gardens” was widely read and influenced the work of Raymond Unwin
and Barry Parker in the design of Letchworth Garden City and Hampstead Garden Suburb,
in which Baillie Scott himself designed houses and other residential buildings. Indeed, his
influence was widespread throughout the world, and his work was widely copied by his son-
in-law and other speculative builders, often without permission.
{1. Today, there is a growing interest in the work of Baillie Scott, as can be seen in the
restoration of “Blackwell” with the aid of a £2.2 million grant. There, open days in National
Architecture Week attracted over 1400 visitors during one weekend (See the article in the
Daily Telegraph at Additional Document 3).
12. In all, Baillie Scott designed over 200 houses, of which it was possible only to
photograph some two dozen in preparing for the exhibition and the book (Haigh 1995),
13. Interest is also demonstrated in the fact that the first imprint of this book (Haigh 1995)
was soon sold out and was reprinted, The exhibition on the work of Baillie Scott travelled
not only to Douglas, but also to other places with Baillie Scott connections; London,
Kendal, Guildford, Bedford, Letchworth and Cheltenham. In the autumn of 1999 it will
ii

Planning Application No: RB 175r
undertake a European tour. A day long seminar on his drawings in the RIBA Drawings
Library has been held in Cambridge under the chairmanship of Margaret Richardson of the
RIBA.
14. All this has shown Baillie Scott to be firmly in the first division of the Arts and Crafts
Movement. Yet little of his work is derivative, always he imposed his own stamp on
whatever was designed. In the course of his career on the Island he turned his back on
designing to recognised “styles”, seeking inspiration rather in the roots of vernacular culture,
and in the “old work” executed by craftsmen before the machine age. He here, on the
Island, learned the value of variation in the textures of materials rather than in applied
decoration.
15. As to the significance of the appeal premises in this history, English Heritage has
published a guide for prospective bidders for Lottery funding for building restoration,
“Conservation Plans for Historic Places”. Whilst not in itself UK Government policy, it
helps prospective bidders assess and present the importance of the buildings concerned. It
urges that not only should the architectural history or design merit be taken into account, but
also a building’s cultural significance, its value to the community, to education, its
townscape character, and its association with historic events.
16. All these considerations should be brought to bear on answering the question of
whether the appeal premises ought to be Registered. In landscape terms, the premises with
their distinctive gables are very prominent, not only from King Edward Road, but also from
across Douglas Bay. The Mansion’s links with local history and culture are again
significant, illustrating through MacAndrew the Island’s links with Liverpool and
Manchester.
17. So much of Baillie Scott’s legacy in the Island has already been destroyed, such as
Glencrutchery House where the interior was stripped out and sold to the USA. What is left
of the building remains of value. Construction of a replica need not be the aim, indeed it
would not be desirable. Rather the existing remains should provide the inspiration for new
work to be woven in sympathetically. The appeal premises should now be looked at ina
positive light.
