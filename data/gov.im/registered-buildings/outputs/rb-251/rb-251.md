REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Church View House
ADDRESS: Main Road, Kirk Michael
POST CODE: IM6 1ER
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Michael Commissioners
GRID REF: 317 907
Introduction
Church View House is an impressive two-storey property located in a prime site on
‘Main Road’, Kirk Michael, opposite the parish church. The decorative Georgian-style
architecture of the front elevation is a distinctive feature of this property and is fairly
unusual within the village.
History
The village of Kirk Michael is predominantly a linear settlement which extends in a
north-south direction along the A3 or ‘Main Road’, as the village section is called.
Historically the parish churchis thought to have been the nucleus for the expansion of
the village and the oldest properties remaining today are all located along Main Road
and are near to the church. Church View House is located in a prime site opposite the
parish church on Main Road and we can therefore surmise that this property is likely to
be a reasonably old building, or it is located on the site of an older structure. The
house had been’ built by the time the 1869 Ordnance Survey Map was surveyed,
although there has been a rear extension added since that time.
In the past, Church View House is said to have been a lodging house (Manxsearch
Ltd., 2001). Brown’s Directory of 1894 says that a retired William Corlett lived at
‘Church View’, however, there is a property called ‘Church View Cottage’ located on
the opposite side of the road and itis unclear which of these buildings the Directoryis
referring to. The nineteenth century census returns for Kirk Michael refer to the
majority of the properties as ‘Village’, so it is very difficult to determine which houses
they are concerning.
To the right of Church View House (facing on) are two small properties which were
formerly known as the schoolhouses. In 1763, Bishop Hildesley purchased these
cottages for the schoolmistress and schoolmaster and set up a fund for their
maintenance. Archive photographs show these cottages were significantly lower than
they are today; although they were originally two-storeys high, the roofs have since
been raised in height, in order to allow more headroom on the first floor. In addition
to this, the location of the front door and ground floor window has switched places on
both of the cottages. Archive photographs also show that the two properties to the
left of Church View House (facing on) have also had their roofs raised in height.

Church View House has not been altered in the century which has passed since the
archive photographs were taken.
Architecture
Church View House is an impressive five-bay property which is two-storeys tall. The
front door is positioned at street level and it opens directly onto the pavement. The
adjoining properties either side of Church View House are small two bay houses which
are much shorter in height.
It is believed that Church View House has been redesigned externally and it now
features a Georgian-style front elevation. The property has retained a traditional Manx
style for a house, being two-storeys tall, featuring a half pitched roof, substantial
chimneystacks and having five bays across the front elevation with a door positioned
centrally underneath.
Archive photographs dating from the turn of the twentieth century show the front of
Church View House has not been altered since that time, even though the smaller
cottages either side of the property have been changed.
The property is smooth-rendered and painted in a light colour. There is a decorative
parapet which hides the roof of the front elevation and seemingly increases the height
of the building without the roof being altered. In addition to this, there are
ornamental pilasters which have been added to both the ground and first floor levels
of the front elevation.
The front door is painted timber and is panelled with a small fanlight positioned over.
The windows are single glazed, painted timber sliding sashes and the majority are in
the Georgian style of six over six panes, with the upper windows being smaller in
height than the lower. The central window on the first floor is different from the rest
as it is a double sash, with two over two panes which fit into the same size opening as
the remainder of the windows on the first floor. An archive photograph of the
property dating to around 1900 shows the windows have not been altered since that
time, even though adjacent properties now have modern replacements.

RECOMMENDATION
Church View House is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for
the following reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
Church View House has a Georgian-style front elevation which is unusual in Kirk
Michael. Archive photographs dating from around the turn of the twentieth century
show that the front elevation has not been altered since at least that time and the
property has retained its traditional style sliding sash windows and panelled front door.
Historic Interest
The property fs focated on an old site within the village. The oldest properties in Kirk
Michael are situated near to the parish church and have front doors which step directly
onto ‘Main Road’ and Church View House is no exception. The house had been
constructed by the time the 1869 Ordnance Survey map had been measured, although
it is likely that this property is much older, or that there was a different property on
this site previously.
Landmark Qualities
Church View House is located on Main Road in Kirk Michael and it is therefore seen by
many people as they pass through the village. The property is taller than the adjacent
houses and has an impressive front elevation, so it is a prominent structure at a local
level.
Age and Rarity
The property dates back to at least the time of the 1869 Ordnance Survey map and it
is likely to be an old property, perhaps having its origins in the eighteenth century.
Photographs which were taken at the turn of the twentieth century show that the front
elevation of the property has retained the same appearance to the present day, even
though the adjoining properties have been altered.
