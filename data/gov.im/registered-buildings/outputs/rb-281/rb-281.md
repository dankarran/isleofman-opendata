History 
The Douglas to Port Erin railway 3 foot gauge line was opened to the public in 1874 and 
included a station at Port St Mary. With the rise in the islandâ€™s tourist industry the original 
timber station building was replaced in 1898 when the current station building and raised 
platform were built. Shortly after in 1902 the Goods shed was constructed. 
 
Constructed in red Ruabon brick in an eclectic vernacular revival style the station shares a pallet 
of materials and some design details with its fellow branch line stations at Douglas and Port 
Erin. The architect of the station has yet to be agreed but has been suggested to be the work of 
either James Cowle or George Kay and the building shares some similarities with the work of 
both architects being responsible for Douglas and Port Erin stations respectively.  
 
The station is second only in scale to Douglas and is a product of the islands late 19th century 
booming tourist industry. It provided accommodation for the Station Master and his family on 
the first floor, which is unique on the island. 
 
During the later 20th century, alterations and additions were made to the station including the 
infilling of the canopy and brick boiler room.  
 
With the decline in the tourist industry the station was closed and leased out. The buildings 
currently remain redundant and have planning permission to be converted into offices.
