Register entry description 
History 
Designed by Charles and David Stevenson, the lighthouse became operational on 15 April 
1914.  
The fog signal, constructed at the same time as the lighthouse, was deactivated in 1987. 
The light was automation in 1993. The former keeper's cottages on the headland above have 
since been sold. 
Details 
MATERIALS: Painted masonry tower with metal framed lantern room. Glazing to lantern room. 
Lower and higher terraces have metal guardings. Internally, metal staircases link concrete 
landings. External walls are finished internally in white glazed ceramic tiles. 
PLAN: Cylindrical tower with very slight taper; terrace at base, including housing for former 

 
fog horn. Terrace/balcony at top of masonry tower below lantern room. 
 
EXTERIOR: Painted masonry tower with feature surrounds to openings. Upper and lower 
terraces have metal balustrades. Lantern room constructed in metal, with glazing framed in a 
lattice pattern. Whilst the lantern room has 360 degree glazing, the landward, westerly, facing 
portion of the glazing is painted black to provide light protection to the former keeper’s 
cottage. 
 
INTERIOR: Spiral stair of 87 steps giving maintenance access to lantern room. As living 
accommodation for lighthouse keeper was provided in a separate building further up the 
headland (connected to the lighthouse by an external stairway of 127 steps), the lighthouse 
tower itself contains no domestic accommodation. Landings are linked by painted metal 
staircases, with brass capping/trim to openings.  
 
Subsidiary Features: The 1st order Fresnel lens and associated equipment, supplied when 
constructed, is still in place, although modern equipment is now used to produce the tower’s 
main light. 
 
 
Reason for Registration Decision

of early 20th century maritime engineering. 
●HISTORIC INTEREST:
