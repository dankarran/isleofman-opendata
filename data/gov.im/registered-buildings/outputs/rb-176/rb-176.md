CENTRAL HOTEL
RAMSEY
Historical Notes
A new road towards Lezayre was being built from 1783 onwards and in 1791 Richard Cowle,
whose house was on the site now occupied by “The Auburns” on Lezayre Road, allowed the
Highways Committee to cut throught his ground, for which courtesy he received £4. In
1797/98, provision was made to secure “ the bridge on Struan e Craue”, also known as
“Mylrea’s Bridge”. This bridge, now greatly extends into and under the roadway of
Parliament Square and received its present arch in 1847. It may well have begun its life as a
wooden foot bridge.
Lezayre Road Brewery, or the North Brewery, on the site now occupied by the Masonic Hall,
was another long established family business, the land, part of Milntown, having been bought
by Thomas Mylrea, son of Archdeacon Daniel Mylrea, from Richard Cowle, in 1797.
Like the Christians of the Flatt, Mr. Mylrea and his family did not operate their own brewery:
John Kneale of Curragh Beg, Bride, was an early lessee, followed by William Paton, and in
due course the brewery was acquired by a Mr. Lane and renamed Royal Albert Brewery .
It is most likely that the original dwelling house now known as The Central Hotel, was built
by Thomas Mylrea for his own use, following his above mentioned purchase of land in 1797.
The property was subsequently occupied by Daniel Mylrea (thought to be William’s
nephew), and during this period the property was referred to as Mylrea’s House.
Thomas Mylrea (1758 - 1830), former M.H.K., died in Ramsey age 70years (Manx Sun -
27.07.1830).
Daniel Mylrea died in 1837 and the following extract (from a much longer advertisement) is
taken from the Manx Sun dated 2TM June, 1837 and is included by way of indicating the
quality of house that the property was and the status of the owner/occupiers within the local
community:

“Brewery, Dwelling House, Stock, Lands, Household furniture etc.
Josiah Herlie begs to inform his Friends and the Public generally, that in consequence of the
death of DANIEL MYLREA Esq,., he has received instructions to let by PUBLIC AUCTION,
on the Premises, on Tuesday the 12 June next for a term of Fourteen years All and Singular
that and those extensive and well accustomed BREWERY and CONCERNS situate near the
Town of Ramsey wherein the late Mr. Mylrea carried on business with great success for the
last twenty years...
...And on Wednesday the 13" June next, will be LET by PUBLIC AUCTION for a term of
years that convenient and commodious DWELLING HOUSE with the Garden, Stable, and
Gig House thereto adjoining, pleasantly situate near the town of Ramsey, late the residence of
Mr. Mylrea deceased...
Immediately after which will be SOLD by PUBLIC AUCTION the whole of the modern
HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE consisting of Mahogany Tables, Chairs, Bedsteads, Beds,
Bedding, Looking glasses, carpets, china, plate, linen and every requisite of a well furnished
House...”
In the Census Returns for Ramsey the house is referred to at different times by various titles:-
DATE PROPERTY NAME OWNER OR OCCUPIER
1841 Mylrea’s House H.B.Frederick Tellet
1851 Mylrea’s House H.B.Frederick Tellet
1861 on Lezayre Road H.B.Frederick Tellet
1871 1 Bowring Road H.B.Frederick Tellet
1881 Old High Bailiff's Residence Mr. Wickert
1891 1 Bowring Road Purcell
The Work of the High Bailiffs
From1777, when the office of Town Captain was abolished, all matters relating to the civil
government of the main towns and their adjacent districts were under the control of the four
High Bailiffs, acting with the authority of successive Lieutenant Governors. Up to 1865, when
Ramsey ontained its Town Commission, the High Bailiff was the only legally constituted
authority (apart from the Harbour and Highway Commissioners), but with no power to levy a
rate to provide amenities and with no official representatives to support him, he had to be the

inspirer or controller of everything which happened in the town or district. It was necessary to
rely on the generosity of individual townspeople whenever money was involved, whether for
the alleviation of the effects of poverty and sickness among the poor, the laying out or repair
of roads, the erection of public monuments such as the Albert Tower, the provision of a
lifeboat, or the encouragement of business men bringing new industry to the town. In the first
part of the nineteenth century the advocates who undertook these onerous duties were
appointed as set out below:-
1794 James Wilks
1805 Thomas Gawne
1812 Ewan Gill
1821 Thomas Arthur Corlett
1828 John Caesar Gilling
1832 Frederick Tellet (died 1873)
High Bailiff Frederick Tellet
Frederick Tellet was associated with and occupied the property now known as The Central
Hotel for at least forty years and he was also the longest serving High Bailiff of Ramsey and
could be considered as a true “Father” of the town. Mr. Tellet was the local dignatory
nominated to go aboard the Royal Yacht which anchored in Ramsey Bay when Queen
Victoria visited Ramsey in 1847: on board he presented an address to the Royal persons
which is reprted as having been “most graciously received”. Within a week of this event, Mr.
Tellet presided over a meeting in Ramsey court house at which it was resolved that a site be
purchased for the purpose of setting up “a fitting Memorial of the Royal Visit”. Land was
gifted by Mr. Edward Stowell of Ballstowell ( to be subsequently known as Tower Farm) and
on the 24" July, 1849 the Albert Tower was officially opened.
High Baillif Tellet was also instrumental in the establishment of the Ramsey National School
(later St. Paul’s Church Institute in Church Street) and was a Trustee of the Ramsey Grammar
School (now the Ramsey Youth Centre) which was commenced in 1864.
By 1891 the Census return shows James Purcell as being in occupation of No 1 Bowring Road
and in the Minutes of the Ramsey Town commissioners of April 1888, permission was
granted for the installation of Bay Windows (which appear not to have been installed): in july
1888, the commissioners are noted as being opposed to Mr. Purcell obtaining a Public House
Licence, however, a proposed addition was approved in February 1891.

The building boom of the 1880’s - 1900 led to the erection of many new hotels in the town
and it is likely that it was during this period that this fine private house was converted for use
as a Public House, in which use it remains to the present day. Should the future viability of the
continued use of the building as Public House at some time come under threat, it is considered
that a change of use befitting the building’s previous status within the town, would be
encouraged.
Architecture
The restrained elegance of the front elevation of the building with its doorway positioned in
the centre of the 5-bay frontage is typical of substantial houses dating from the late eighteenth,
or early nineteenth century, in what is locally known as the Manx Georgian style. The overall
form of the building with its “MI” - shaped roof profile, is likely indication of an early,single
pitched roof building having been extended by the addition of a second pitched roof structure,
usually in front of the original dwelling, giving an opportunity to present a new principal
facade to the world at large. The style and period of the architecture of the existing front
elevation gives further justification to the theory that the original building, probably the rear
section, dates from the eighteenth century.
At ground floor level on the front elevation, the central entrance is set within a canopied
portico which employs engaged, supporting columns of the Tuscan Order: on either side of
the entrance are located two window openings, each of which is marked with a raised,
modelled surround and topped with a panelled frieze and canopy, echoing that over the door.
At first floor the five windows again have raised, modelled surrounds, but are marked by
classical pediments. The whole composition is topped by a panelled parapet which was once
graced by ball finials at the corner positions.The original window frames would have been
small-paned Georgian, probably six-on-six sliding sashes, but the existing windows on the
main frontage are probable Victorian substitutes, which do not look out of place. Window
openings and frames on other elevations are more hap-hazzard and in a variety of syles, which
also include sliding sashes, which are the appropnate opening style for this property.
Over the years Ramsey has seen the loss of much of its historic fabric which included other
buildings which would have been contemporaries of this building. There is a presumption in
favour of preserving buildings dating from the Georgian period, which is weighted even more
heavily, when considered against the context of the past loss of so much of the town’s historic

buildings. The presence of the building which was for so long the home of High Bailiff
Frederick Tellet, opposite the seat of the town’s succeeding goveming body, the Ramsey
Town Commissioners, provides a tangible link with the town’s historic development and is to
be valued.
The Central Hotel also makes a major contribution to the Island’s built environment, not only
within the local context of Ramsey Town, where it provides a visual end stop on the axis of
the town’s main street, Parliament Street, but in the wider context of the Isle of Man Tourist
Trophy Road Racing circuit; the Hotel is a land mark on the course being well known to local
fans, as well as those who come from further afield.
The Central Hotel, Ramsey, formerly known as The Old High Bailiff’s Residence, is
judged worthy of entry into the Protected Buildings Register on the following grounds:-
1. AGE AND RARITY -The original building is judged to have been constructed circa
1797, or shortly thereafter and is consequently some two hundred years old or
thereabouts. As such the property merits entry into the Register;
. HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION WITH PERSONS OF NOTE -The property has
Ww
played an important part in the historical development of the town of Ramsey being
associated for a period approaching forty years, with the town’s longest serving and
most influential High Bailiff, Frederick Tellet.
3. AESTHETIC QUALITY -The building has a considerable degree of architectural
merit and js located in a very prominent position in Ramsey’s Parliament Square,
facing along the axis of the main street, Parliament Street. As such it makes a
substantial and positive contribution to the streetscape of the town.
4. LAND MARK QUALITY -The Central Hotel is a well known land mark on the Isle
of Man T.T. Road Racing Course and this is considered to be a positive factor in
assessing the merits as being worthy of entry into the Register.
