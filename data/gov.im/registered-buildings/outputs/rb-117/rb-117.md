Registry Entry Summary – Kate’s Cottage 
 
Details 
Name: Kate’s Cottage 
Address: Mountain Road, Onchan, IM4 5BP 
Register Entry Number: 117 
Date of Registration: 11.09.1989 
 
History 
Originally built as a shepherd’s cottage, the current building is thought to date from shortly after 
1860, although the plan form shown on the first edition OS Map is substantially different from the 
current external plan form, and this may mean that the cottage is slightly later than 1860. The first 
inhabitant is thought to have been Anthony Haddon, who worked for the land owner G M Jones. 
 
The cottage was historically named Keppel Gate Cottage, and historic photographs suggest that the 
cottage was single storey when first built. 
 
The inhabitants of the cottage in the 1920s were a family named Tate, and during this period the 
property was known as ‘Tate’s Cottage’. In 1926 the cottage is described as having a big kitchen, tiny 
parlour, 2 bedrooms and a box room. There was no bathroom and the toilet was external. 
 
A commentator on the TT Races in the 1930s mistakenly referred to the cottage as ‘Kate’s Cottage’ 
rather than ‘Tate’s Cottage’, and the property has been known by this name since this time. 
 
Between 2017 and 2022 the cottage underwent significant restoration works, with many historic 
features restored that had previously been lost. The cottage’s historic name stone ‘Keppel Gate 
Cottage’, has been reclaimed and now resides in the front garden. The metal gates on the boundary 
of the mountain road have been newly fabricated to replicate the form of the historic Keppel Gate 
that once gave access to the mountain road. 
 
The historic ‘Keppel Gate’ Gatepost that can be seen in historic photographs adjacent to the cottage 
is now sited further up the road near to the marshalling spot now known as Keppel Gate. The post is 
thought to have been moved in 1929 when the mountain road was widened. 
 
Form and Materials 
Two storey, three bay cottage with single storey pitched roof former cattle store on the western 
gable. White painted render walls, slate pitched roofs, timber sliding sash windows with aluminium 
coating on external face. The front elevation features a porch with a monopitch lean-to roof, and an
