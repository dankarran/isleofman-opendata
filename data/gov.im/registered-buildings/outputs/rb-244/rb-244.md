REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Red Cross House (Former Methodist Chapel)
ADDRESS: Derby Road, Douglas
POST CODE: IM2 3EN
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GRID REF: 237913 E 476356 N
Introduction
Red Cross House is located in the upper Douglas Woodbourne Road Conservation Area.
Situated on the corner of Derby Road and Park Road, it maintains a position of prominence as it
is approached from Broadway.
History
The Methodist New Connexion, (M.N.C) similar in its doctrines to the Wesieyans, was a new
religious sect that came about during a time when several small religious groups were being
formed with varying success throughout Britain, following the death of John Wesley in 1791,
(Branches of the Methodist Church. Cited www.infoplease.com)
Originally founded by Alexander Kilham from his church in Sheffield, (The Methodist New
Connexion (sic) Cited, wikpedia.org/wki/Methodist) the new sect soon thrived and quickly
expanded, particularly across the north of England. In 1886, records show that a place of
worship ‘fora company of former Methodists’ was \ocated at 1 Athol Street, Douglas, In the
same year the Isfe of Man was given the status of Home Mission Station and John Shaw was
placed in overall charge. (Coakley. F. 2001. Manx Methodist Historical Society Newsletter 17)
By the late 19" Century, Douglas was rapidly expanding though poorly ‘missioned’, according to
reports from the time. (Coakley. F. 1999, Methodist Chapels in Douglas. Cited
www.isleofman.com/manxnotebook) Subsequently, it was decided to ‘sanction 'the building of a
chapel, commissioned by the council of the Methodist New Connexion under John Shaw, 1886.
(ibid)
Records for 1888 show that there were four societies of the Methodist New Connexion that
existed on the Island at this time (ibid), however delegates were sceptical about the
need/justification for a new chapel given the limited numbers of followers on the Island. None
the less, a site was subsequently purchased for £1,800.00(//d). The establishment of such a
church would serve the twin functions of bringing together the dispersed elements of the
church followers on the Island, whilst providing a centre of worship for the increasing numbers
of ...” members of M.N.C.... taking holidays here’ (ibid) who had travelled here from the north

west of England, Subsequently, the building of this new chapel was to be sited in Douglas, the
chosen site being Derby Road.
Opened in 1890, the church could accommodate about 500 people. Total cost of the building
was £2,500.00 including a plot of land to bullda school. (Isle of Man Examiner, 19 july, 1890.
Cited Coakley. F. 1999, Manx note book)
Red Cross House (as it is now known as) fronts both Derby Road and Park Road, both laid out
across what was formally the Woodbourne estate. (Frith. W, 1889, Area Plans. Douglas
Borough Archive). The church, erected in 1890, was designed by W. Frith of Oldham and built
by W. Kelly of Douglas. The original block plans indicate the adjacent road as Brisbane Street!
This was later to become Park Road which was set out in 1892. (Slack.S. 1996. Streets of
Douglas, Old and New)
Located close by, the Douglas School of Science, later known as Park Road School, opened in
1894, and shares many common features with the Methodist Chapel. These being
predominantly the Red Raubon brick detailing, off-set by the light coloured local brick.
The Methodist New Connexion numbers on the Island were never strong and subsequently from
1907 attendance figures fell steadily until in 1914 the property was sold to St Thomas’ Church
to be used as a school hall (Chapman. S. 1971. Cited Manx Methodist Historical Society
Newsletter 17). Up until it was sold in the mid 1970's, the church served a number of additional
functions. These ranged from being used as an overflow from Park Road School prior to the
building of St Ninian’s High School for boys and as the headquarters for the 10th Douglas
Scouts (later renamed the Sth Douglas), At one point it was also used by the St Francis’ private
schoo! which was also located in Derby Road, before becoming the headquarters of the Red
Cross,
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
The majority of churches/chapels throughout the Island are of dressed stone /rubble
construction. Whilst a small number of brick built churches/chapels do exist on the Island, these
are in the minority and generally of no particular architectural merit. Derby Road Methodist
Church however, was clearly designed and built as a ‘show case’ church, displaying the most
contemporary of innovations in architectural detailing, whilst retaining the acceptable format of
what constituted a house of worship.
The building itself comprises of nave, gallery and transcepts which were separated from the
nave by moveable screens decorated with tinted cathedral glass. Elsewhere the use of stained
glass has been limited in both its form and style, but also in its quantity. Used predominantly in
the small lancet windows and tracery of the main tower, they consist of simple geometric
designs. The exceptions to these being the larger tracery windows displaying a mixture of
geometric and floral motifs.
The use of constructional polychromy, as first advocated by Ruskin, had gained in popularity
from 1850/60’s and so became something of a Victorian ‘trademark’ in church design. It
comprised of contrasting coloured brick or stone, which in turn could extend to the use of
contrasting slates of differing shades.
Author: S. Moore, Building Conservation Officer 6 15” August 2007

Such detailing was employed by Frith in creating contrasting areas between the Ruabon brick
detailing and terracotta work, and the light faced brickwork used as the infill. Elsewhere Frith
has employed terracotta detailing in the form of hollow rounded ridge tiles which off-set the
grey expanse of slate and so continues the theme of contrasting colours throughout the
building.
The perimeter wall and main entrance gate are also a combination of Glenfaba brick, Ruabon
brick and moulded terracotta. These latter mouldings depict what appear to be compressed four
leaf floral designs. Similar floral motifs were a common and elaborate feature of the Aesthetic
Movement's influences of the late 1800's, particularly in their depictions of sunflowers.
The bricks were produced focally on the Island, believed to be from the Ballanard Brick, Tile and
Terra~Cotta Works located a mile outside of Douglas, (Coakley F. 2004. cited Mercantile
Manxiland, p2. 1900) who were producing ever increasing quantities in order to meet the
increased demand in their products at this time. It was noted that the quality of their products
being ‘unsurpassed by any other maker’ (ibid). However, in its report on the opening of what
was then, the Methodist New Connexion chapel at Derby Road, The Isle of Man Examiner states
that; “The church is built of Glenfaba brick, relieved by Ruabon bricks and tera-cotta (sic) which
will make this building one of the hansomest (sic) of its kind in the Island.” (Isle of Man
Examiner 19th July, 1890. Cited, Methodist Chapels in Douglas).
Stylistically, the church, through its use of innovative use of contemporary materials, could be
viewed as an attempt by the nonconformist church to distance itself from the established
Anglican Church. However, whilst design played a major role, the issue of cost was also
paramount, In this respect, the use of réadily available bricks in different colours and mouldings
served to produce strikingly modern designs whilst being able to be constructed quickly and
relatively cheaply.
It could be argued that Frith’s design, whilst drawing on these points also capitalised on the
established trend of the period by embellishing the church in a muted, neo - Gothic decorative
manner, employing moulded terracotta to produce the tracery window designs in conjunction
with larger sand stone tracery windows on the ground floor. All this helped serve the purpose of
promoting their cause, especially important in the case of the Methodist New Connexion as their
existing congregation was relatively small and somewhat dispersed on the Island. (Coakley.F.
2001. Manx Methodist Historical Society Newsletter 17. p1.)
Dixon and Methesius (Victorian Architecture. 1978. p232.) state that an essential feature of
Nonconformist church architecture was the provision of subsidiary facilities contained within the
church. These generally comprised of teaching and utility rooms, as was the inclusion of a
separate school within the church boundary, all of which are to be found in the Derby Road
Methodist Chapel. The combination of contemporary materials combined with its architectural
style incorporating these ‘additional features,’ was seen as essential components in encouraging
attendance and subsequent use of the facilities.

Recommendation
Red Cross House is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for the
following;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
Its unique architectural style (in respect to the Island) is representative of the stylistic
associations predominant throughout England during the latter part of the 19" Century and the
subsequent rarity of such ecclesiastical designs here on the Island.
Both the church and the near-by school, built within a few years of each other, uniquely
complement each other stylisticaily.
Historic Interest
The Church forms a unique link between late 19th century architectural developments and the
Methodist Church’s attempt to capitalise upon this ‘contemporary’ style in order to promote its
teachings here on the Island.
Age and Rarity
Though of no great significant age, Derby Road Methodist Church is representative of an
architectural style that gained some, though limited support here on the Island. In addition to
this, the church is unique in that it represents the only ecclesiastical interpretation of this
architectural ‘trend’ here on the Island and as such should be protected under Registration.
Bears close stylistic similarities with the United Reform Church in Sutton-in-Ashfield (opened
1906, cited Churches and Chapels p5 .oldnotts.co.uk), This church also employs many matching
elements seen at Derby Road, Douglas, including the use of stone tracery windows off-set
against Ruabon brickwork and terra-cotta detailing.
Landmark Qualities
The church spire is a prominent feature throughout the locality including the lower section of
Derby Road as one approaches from the bottom of Broadway off the promenade.
Group Value
Derby Road Methodist Church is one of a smali number of buildings that are representative of
the use of polychromatic brickwork in addition to the use of Terra-Cotta detailings and Ruabon
brick, redolent of the 1880’s 1890's design movement.
As a representative of this late 19th Century architectural style, Derby Road Methodist Church
shares many of these stylistic features with a small number of other building here on the Island
which include; The Ridgeway, The Wheatsheaf and Park Road School.
Together they form a smali, yet important element in tracing the development/progression of
architectural developments here on the Island.
