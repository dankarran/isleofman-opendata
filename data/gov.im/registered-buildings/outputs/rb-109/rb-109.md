R.B.109
Appeal by the Finch Hill United Reform Church
under the provisions of Section 7 of the
Registered Buildings (General) Regulations 1987
in respect of Registered Building No. 109, Finch
Hill United Reform Church, Bucks Road, Douglas.
The material points made by the parties were
For the
Appellants
The church building was not of sufficient architectural
or historic interest to warrant it being registered. The
registration appeared to be based solely on information
supplied by the Manx Museum and the opinion of the
Architect and Planning Officer of the Department of Local
Government and the Environment. The evidence
substantiating the registration consisted of details of
the Architects, details of the Stone Mason, and details
of particular features, which were principally the
clerestory windows and the gargoyles on the tower. The
Architect and Planning Officer accepted that his opinion
was purely subjective and that it was not supported by
any other expert opinion and, it was significant that the
Manx Museum had made no contribution to the Inquiry. It
was important to recognise that the registration of
buildings was not based on any known criteria and could
well be said to often occur as a result of a whim on an
individual’s part. In the case of the appeal premises no
detailed reasons for the registration of the building had
ever been disclosed and at no time had the appellants
been told of the precise qualities of the architectural
or historic interest that had led to the spontaneous
registration. The opportunity for registration had
existed since the passing of the Town and Country
Planning Act of 1981 on the 19th January 1982, yet seven
years had passed by and during that time the building was
not judged worthy of registration. It would be quite
wrong that the burden of maintaining the building, which
flowed inevitably from the act of registration, was
placed upon the appellants on the flimsy and limited
evidence on historic matters and the opinion of one
person on the architectural aspects. Special account
should also be given to the views of the Douglas
Corporation in whose local authority domain the church
stood. The local elected representatives saw no reason
to retain the building and that was a important fact when
it was remembered that there was often considerable local
opposition to the loss of a well known landmark.

cont’d
Expert evidence, unrefuted by the Department of Local
Government and the Environment, showed that the fabric of
the appeal premises was deteriorating and would continue
to do so unless a considerable sum of money was spent on
immediate repairs and remedial works. In 1985 the
estimated cost of the works was £53,000 and since then
other defects have occurred bringing the current estimate
of these works to between £200,000 and £280,000. The
resources of the church could not cope with these costs
and it had been reluctantly accepted by the church
authority that the building had outlived its useful
economic life as a church because of the increasing rate
of dilapidation and the inability of the authority to
fund repairs.
In response to suggestions from the Department of Local
Government and the Environment the church authority had
canvassed experts on the possibility of alternative uses
but it was evident, that the building was not a
commercial proposition. The building could not be
converted into offices because the costings could not
support the modest additional floor space that would be
created. A figure of £500,000 had been estimated as the
cost of putting a second floor into the main body of the
building and for that sum only one half of the existing
ground floor space could be provided. To create only
1600 square feet of floor space at a cost of £500,000 was
nonsensical. In any event an appraisal of the office
potential of the church had concluded that the building
was incapable of providing the type of office unit that
could accommodate current office technological needs.
The consensus of all experts in the area of commercial
and possible alternative uses for the church was
unequivocal, there was no possibility of creating a
viable project.
The Planning Officer and Architect for the Department of
Local Government and the Environment had informed the
Inquiry that in conversation with the Chief Executive of
the Department he had been told that Government funds
could be made available for the repairs, restoration and
remedial works necessary to put the church into a sound
condition. The evidence given by the Planning Officer
and Architect was that an ad hoc application for funds
should be made and it was possible that these could be
forthcoming if an acceptable case was submitted. It was

A.P.200 Cont’d
R.B.109
clearly inferred that there was a change in the approach
to these matters hitherto taken by Government. on
examination of these statements however, it was found
that there was no fund in hand for such ventures. The
most that could be offered was the opportunity to present
a case to the Treasury who might be prepared to discuss
the possibility of a grant. It also became apparent that
not only was the whole issue dependent upon the role of
the Treasury, who could decline to discuss the matter,
but that any approach must be supported by calculations
on the costs of repairs and restoration. The church
authority did not possess the resources to pay
consultants fees on a speculative exercise that was
entirely dependent on the choice of a Government
Department as to whether it would or would not discuss a
proposal. The opportunity for Government aid was
available under the Registered Buildings (Financial
Assistance) Regulations 1982 but it was agreed that there
was no fund set aside for the purposes of these
regulations. As to the Act of 1991, soon to be
operative, the financial assistance provision in Section
15 differed little from the 1982 Regulations and again
there was no fund set aside and no indication that
financial provision would be a concomitant of Section 15
of the Act. The likelihood of Government financial aid
was so tenuous as to the leave the appellants no
alternative other than to seek the removal of the church
from the Register. The church authority was in an
identical position to that of a large commercial
organisation on the Island who had successfully had their
building removed from the Register because of the
financial burden of restoration. The fundamental
difference between the parties however was the ability of
a commercial company to finance the works of restoration
whereas this was an impossibility for the church
authority.
For the Department of Local Government and the Environment
The Planning Committee had no established criteria
against which the architectural or historic interest of a
building was judged. What was taken into account was the
age of the building, its aesthetic qualities, the extent
to which it was representative or unique, the identity of
the architect or builder, the physical context of the
building and an assessment of its contribution to the

A.P.200
R.B.109
cont'd
townscape or landscape. The relevant information supplied
to the Department by the Manx Museum were the dates of
construction, probably 1866, the materials of the fabric
together with particular features and the name of the
Architect and Stone Mason. The information highlighted
the fact that the clerestory windows were unique in Manx
ecclesiastical architecture and drew attention to the
buttresses, the tracery windows and the gargoyles on the
tower. On the basis of this information, together with
expert advice, it was the judgment of the Planning
Committee that because the building was of good aesthetic
quality, included as least one unique feature and made a
substantial contribution to the townscape of a busy and
densely populated area, Registration was justified.
The Planning Committee were aware of the financial
circumstances of the church authority, the falling
numbers of the congregation and the inability of members
to raise funds for repairs and restoration. Nevertheless
it was believed that alternative viable uses were
possible with the provision of additional floor space if
necessary. Until it was demonstrated that a conversion
was neither feasible nor financial viable the building
and its setting should remain Registered.
‘The judgment on architectural merit did not require that
the building be of outstanding, significant or even
special interest, merely that some of the building was
architecturally interesting and as in the case of the
church, was important in the street scene. A number of
successful conversions of similar buildings had been
undertaken but until the fullest possible facts were made
available as to likely costs and viability it could not
be judged whether the church was suitable. While the
evidence from the appellants suggested that there was no
market interest in a conversion of the church at present
that would not necessarily be the case in the future.
Without positive evidence to support the claim that
conversion was not economically practicable the building
should remain protected.
It was possible that Government funds could be made
available for the works needed to render the building
sound. Details of the costs involved would need to be
submitted for the consideration of the Government
Departments concerned who then may be prepared to discuss

A.P.200 cont'd
R.B.109
the situation. It was acknowledged that no central fund
existed for the care and repair of Registered buildings
and that no payment had ever been made under provisions
of existing legislation.
For the Douglas Corporation
The Corporation were satisfied that the church had no
architectural merit or amenity quality and they
considered that the fabric of the building was in such
poor condition that it would be unreasonable to expect
the small congregation to pay for repairs and upkeep. No
alternative use was possible for the building in their
opinion and the small congregation should not be denied
the opportunity to provide themselves with a place of
worship which they could afford to build and maintain.
The registration of the walls, railings and grassed areas
around the church prevented the Corporation from
constructing a much needed bus layby that would relieve
traffic congestion in Bucks Road. It was the strongly
held opinion of the Local Authority that the church in
its entirety should be removed from the Register.
Conclusions
10.
There must be doubts about the criteria used by the
Department of Local Government and the Environment to
reach a judgment that a building has the necessary
architectural or historical qualities to warrant its
retention as a continuing liability for the owners. It
seems to me that when a critical judgment of this nature
is made that the research undertaken, the factual
information available and a second validating opinion
should be made known rather than by the use of the
undisclosed methods upon which the decision to Register
buildings appears to be made at present. Unless these
facts are known the persons responsible for the care of
the Registered building cannot properly argue a case for
its removal from the Register. In the case of Finch Hill
Church the registration is based on limited facts that do
not, in my view, support the contention of either
architectural merit or historic interest, and a
subjective opinion. I believe that the basis of
registration was successfully contested by the appellants
who were able to show that the building had no history of
any significance, that the architectural merits were

neither special nor outstanding and that in the context
of civic design, the loss of the building would not cause
unacceptable ‘harm to the Bucks Road street scene in the
neighbourhood.
The facts and evidence in support of the appellant’s case
on the future of the church building were unchallenged
and it is evident, in my view, that without substantial
funding from sources outside the church authority the
building will continue to deteriorate to the point of
abandonment and possibly demolition for safety reasons.
I have noted the views given to the Inquiry about the
possibility of the Government hecoming responsible for
the remedial works to the church. It was clear however
that there was no certainty about this role and that the
involvement of the appellants in any submissions would
require them to commit themselves to financing surveys
and reports at some expense in the knowledge that an
application for funds may not even be accepted for
discussion purposes. I was not persuaded by the evidence
that monies would be easily or readily available.
Therefore since the church authority could at the end of
a protracted period of uncertainty find themselves in the
position that obtains today, I consider that it would be
unreasonable and unfair to the authority to take account,
on this occasion, of something as imponderable as the
question of Government financial aid. There is nothing,
of course, to preclude this aspect of the problem from
being resolved by action on the part of the Government at
any time.
I do not consider, on the basis of the evidence and facts
put to the Inquiry, that a sustainable case has been
argued by the Department of Local Government and the
Environment to justify the continued registration of
Finch Hill church.
Recommendation
13.
That the appeal be allowed.
