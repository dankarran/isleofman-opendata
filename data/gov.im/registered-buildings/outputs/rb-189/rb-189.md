CLOSE LAKE, ANDREAS
INTRODUCTION
It is recorded in the Christian Papers, held in the Manx Museum archive, that Close
Lake, or Lough Mollo in ancient times, was thought to be named after a nearby lake
(post glacial?), long since drained, called Malax Lake.
The Christian family were important landowners on the Isle of Man, during the later
half of the second millennium, owning land throughout the Island at this time.
The farms connection to the Christian family dates from the early 16" Century.
However, the earliest official date for Close Lake is 1703 when the name appears on
the list of intack land for Andreas. A Manx Advertiser report, dated July 1840,
announces the wedding of Rev. William Bell Christian, of Close Lake, second son of
Deemster Christian of Milntown, to Miss Charlotte Elizabeth Brine, eldest daughter
of the late Thomas Brine Esq. It is very likely that the current house was constructed
around this date for the newly married couple.
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST
The farm is on low-level, flat land that at the time of our visit, in early January, was
partly flooded. It is shown as intact land on Woods Atlas and it is suspected that the
farm was improved to become a viable farm during the early Victorian era, when
investment for land drainage was more readily available.
We would speculate that the present house was built at the time of the Rev. W.B.
Christian’s marriage. The house style is mid-Victorian and is entirely appropriate for
this date and circumstance.
The farm buildings are also very striking as they are set out around a courtyard and
one suspects the influence of Victorian thinking, particularly that of John Christian
Curwen (Rev. W.B. Christian’s grandfather), regarding Model Farms.
HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION .
The Christian family, owners of Close Lake for four centuries, have well known
historical links to the Isle of Man, with Uliam Dhone considered a Martyr by many
Manxmen and women. Several Christians have entries in the book Manx Worthies,
including John Christian Curwen M.P. (1756 — 1828) a renowned agricultural
reformer and innovator, Deemster John Christian (1776 — 1852) and the Rev. William
Bell Christian (1815 - 1886).
The earliest, unconfirmed Christian connection is a reference to Robert, son of
William McCristen VI (died c.1535) who ‘was of Lough Mollo’.
There are other unconfirmed reports that the Radcliffes, Calcotts and Heywoods,
other well-known Manx families, also owned portions of ‘Lough Mollo’,
However, a Manx Advertiser report, in February 1824, refers to a Petition on Tithes
by Deemster John Christian of Mullen Beg and Close Lake. He argued, and in 1839,
that no separate tithes were due on Close Lake owing to Close Lake being part'of the
Milntown estate. He claimed that when John McChristen purchased Miintown, in
1511, it included the ‘closes in the Myres’.
Approaching the mid 17" Century, the period of Civil unrest in England and the
disputes between the Manx and the Crown, Close Lake was seized, from the

Christians, by Governor John Greenhalge. However, it was restored to its rightful
owners sometime between 1647 ~ 1650, —
It is known that the Sayle family were long-term tenants of the farm, as this is
mentioned by Deemster John Christian. Almost certainly in 1810 the Sayles were
farming the land as an unfortunate accident is reported in the Manx Advertiser on the
7 April that year. The article reports that John Sayle of Close drowned in a marl pit.
One assumes the item refers to the marl pits almost adjacent to Close Lake.
Although it is speculated that the current house was built for the Rev. W.B. Christian,
it is possible that he did not occupy it. He became the Chaplain of St. John’s in 1840,
took the ‘living’ in Lezayre in 1845, and is known to have been provided
accommodation by the Church. On the death of his father in 1852 he succeeded to
Milntown.
According to the Christian Papers Close Lake was left in Deemster John Christian’s
Will to one of his daughters and that the Rev. W. B. Christian later bought it off his
sister. Certainly he is recorded as the ‘owner’ on the Wood’s Atlas in 1867.
Rev. W. B. Christian, who became M.H.K. for Ramsey in 1867, was a man with his
finger in a lot of pies, including the railways (he and J.C. LaMothe, the Island’s
Governor, were the principal shareholders in the Manx Northern Railway), and
borrowed heavily to fund these investments. Unfortunately, several of these ventures
proved less than astute and ultimately led to the downfall of the Christian family
fortunes. The collapse of the Glasgow Bank played a very significant part in the
demise, as did the strain of annuities for four sisters and the expenses of his own
family. Mortgages were foreclosed and the Law Life Assurance Society (later the
Phoenix Assurance) finally took possession of the properties in 1904.
Close Lake has been linked, through the probable ownership of John Christian
Curwen, to Model Farms and agricultural improvements.
John Curwen, who was both an M.P. and an M.H.K., could be described as one of the
founding fathers of modern farming methods and was involved directly in the
adoption of new farming practices in England, Ireland and the Isle of Man.
In the latter part of the 18” Century he wrote a report
on how inefficient Manx
farming was at that time, as farmers were only cultivating a small proportion of their
land. Most of it he said was left to grow over with heather and gorse.
He actively promoted the drainage and reclamation of wasteland, something that he
carried out on his own farms. It is a strong possibility that Close Farm would have
benefited from this advice, and that improvements were carried out on the farm in the
early 1800’s.
He started the Workington Agricultural Society, and its work so impressed the Manx
gentry that they resolved to have a branch in the L.o.M. In 1806, under the Presidency
of John Curwen, a Manx branch of the Society was formed in the Island.
In 1808 John Curwen published a book entitled ‘Hints on the Economy of Feeding
Stock and Bettering the Conditions of the Poor’, and many of his ideas and practises
became almost ‘industry standard’. Although now considered sensible husbandry at
the time they were considered by many to be almost ‘revolutionary’.
He introduced the widespread use of mechanisation, labour saving designs and
intensive methods to increase production and profits. Whereas before, many’ farms
worked on almost a subsistence basis, his methods were geared to producing a surplus
for sale and an increase in consumption. However, during times of hardship his
charity to the needy was well received as he instructed farming produce, such as milk,
to be sold at below cost price.

He particularly, impressed the Quayle brothers of Castletown, who became his ‘Manx
Disciples’ and they themselves wrote about the state of agriculture in the Lo.M. in
1794 and 1812. The 1812 version acknowledges the role played by John Curwen and
the Society in the improvements made in Manx agriculture.
Tt had been suggested that Hall Caine may have lived at Close Lake, or used it as an
‘accommodation’ address, during the time he served as M.H.K. for Ramsey.
However, there is no mention in his biography, by Vivienne Allen, of him living any
where else on the Island other than Greeba Castle (that he bought in 1896) and prior
to that 4 Marine Parade in Peel. No other evidence to date has been uncovered to
support such a supposition and Ulla Corlett, who is acknowledged by the Manx
Museum as another reliable source on Hall Caine, confirmed the unlikelihood of this
being so. Subsequently, the Conservation Officer spoke to Vivienne Allen and she
suggested that it was still possible that he may have used Close Lake as an address of
convenience at some time.
Hall Caine did own other properties on the Island, and in fact it would appear that he
owned Mullen Lowin in Andreas during the time he was a M.H.K., as the electoral
roll records this information. It would seem odd for him to own a property in Andreas,
yet use another address nearby for ‘accommodation’ purposes.
The only reference (in the electoral roll records held in the Manx Museum), that
possibly relates, to Close Lake during Hall Caine’s time as an M.HLK. is in 1902. A
Frederick Joughin is listed as the occupier of Close, Close Intacks.
AGE
Close Lake is a typical mid-Victorian double fronted detached house. The side wing
facing the road would appear to be of a later date but is shown on the 1860’s series
O.S. The front porch is Edwardian and although in poor condition is very nicely
detailed and makes the house more unusual. The house also retains nice cornicing,
eaves details and original sash windows. The entrance gates and garden features, such
a trees, would also appeared to date from the period of the construction of the house.
RARITY
Although Ramsey has many examples of mid-Victorian houses, this house retains
many original features, including entrance gates and fixtures and fittings, which
increases its significance over other Ramsey buildings.
GROUP VALUE
The association of this house with the garden, the gates, farm and surrounding
landscape does give this building a unique and significant value; especially if the
design of the farm can be linked back to the Christian family, and more particularly to
John Curwen and his influence on Model Farms dating from the 1800’s.
