OLD BALLAUGH CHURCH
[It is believed that a church has been located at the site of the old
Ballaugh church ever since the introduction of Christianity to the Island.
However, possibly the first recorded mention of a church existing on the
site was in 1231, within a Papal Bull. °
A church on the site was rebuilt in 1717, by Bishop Wilson, but the building
of the existing church was instigated by Bishop Ward, as one of seven to be
erected around the Island, and the Architect John Welch was commissioned to
design the building. It was completed and consecrated on 27th September
1832.
In 1848, the Rev. John Mason Neale, a High Church leader, visited the Island
and, commenting on Ballaugh Church, noted "though new, it is evidently
rebuilt on the old plan, and its west facade is extremely interesting, it
has a western porch, which I suppose resembled that at Kirk Maughold, and
from this two flat square-edged pilasters rear up to the campanile .. which
is of the same character as in our own Saxo churches. It is much to be
wished that the original work remained; as it is, such a glimpse is more
tantalising than instructive."
The church was restored and altered by Rev. Thomas Howard in 1849 and again
in 1879 by the Rev.William Kermode.

Ghe Ol Church of
St. Wary de Ballaugh
‘The Old Church of St Mary de Ballaugh ((rom Bal-ny-laghey, homestead of the Curragh, of,
more probably, from Bal-laff, Our Lady’s Place) occupiesa site of some importance
in pre-historic
times. In 1677 the grave of a young chieftain, dating hundreds of yeors before the coming of
Christianity to the Istend, was found 100 yards east from the Churchyard wall. Sepulchral vens
have been found elsewhere in the parish. Like other ancient Manx Parish Churches, tis almost
certainly the successor of Celuc and Norse Churches on the same site, and it contains material in
its walls from previous buildings, notably the few remaining dressed stones used as cornerstones
‘The bell-cote resembles those in Saxon churches
in England
‘The church 1s first mentioned in # Papal Bull of 1201. The earliest known Rector was Donald
McCorkylt (1408) and though little 1s known of the church’s history before 1700, it would be like
other old Manx Churches, rectangular and three times as long as wide. In 1717 wt was lengthened by
21 feet, the parish paying £12 and Bishop Wilson the rest. A gable was added at the west end,
adorned by two pilasters and surmounted by a bell cote Trachitton says that the two gate pillars
were purposely built leaning in They are not earlier than the 1&th century.
Between 1757 and 1777 rear and side galleries, reached by an outer double stairway rising on
‘either side of the porch, were erected by Rector James Wilks. The present north-side windows are
18th century at the earhest, and replace two small openings of earher umes Because the Manx
people believed Jeremiah’s statement that evil came from the north, there were very few windows
fn the north side ofthe Old Manx Churches
In (832 the new Parish Church was butlt This was because the Old Church was then in 8 very
bad state of repair st was situated # long way from the village. and it could only seat 350
1n a parish
of 1487 people For some years the Oid Church was disused and fell into decay, but in 1849 it was
rescued by Rector Howard who re rooted it, removed the galleries and took down the 1717 extension
to the chancel, thus reducing the length by one third. It was further restored by Rector Kermode in
1877 and again by Rector Elliott in 1955, since when it has been regularly used for Worship
Evensong is Sand every Sunday at 6 p m_and Holy Communion is Celebrated at Christmas. Easter
Harvest Thanksgiving and on the second Sunday of the month. Baptisms, Weddings and Funerals
also take place
In the Church 1s an 11th century Runic Cross, the only one found in Batlaugh, which shows
features of the great sculptor Gaut The weather-wom Runic lettering runs "Ouliabr Lovtulfsunt
rassti krs thana aftar Ulb sun Sin” (Olaf Liotulfson erected this cross to the memory of UIE his son}
‘The Fort, made outofa
red sandstone block, and built into a window-sil, 18 of unknown antiquity
tis decorated with a eross cut n relief. and the Manx inscription runs "Ta un Chiarn, un Credjue,
tun Vashtey, un Jee as Ayr jeh cattle” ("There 1s one Lord ore Faith, one Baptism, one God and
Father of ali")
(On the North-East comer
of the Church 1s a sandstone block which once bore the word ~"
ton”,
‘The two Jacobean chairs in the sanctuary were given hy Bishop Wilson (died 1755) and the
reading desk and pulpit were given hy Bishop Hridesley and Rector Wilks in 1772 The earhest
memorial 1n the Churchyard 1s to “Anne Ellison, 1654” The Burial Register begins at 1598 (the
oldest in the Island) the Baptismal Register in 1607, and the Wedding Register in 1695 ‘The Old
Registers had become very dilapidated, so they were copied out by Thomas Howard (Rector ~
1836-76).
Al sotts of changes, good and bad, have occurred since 1717 when the restored church was re-
opened, and great events have occurred in the history of ourIsland and the world, but still the Old
Parish Church stands here, and still people come, like their forefathers, to Worship
God It wall still
be here when even the youngest of us 1s no more, a silent witness to Jesus Chnsst, the same yester:
day, today and for ever Still visitors from our big towns come in summer to enjoy its Peace and
quiet, which makes all our bustle and noise seem so silly. As vou stand in the Church, remember
the generations of Rectors and people who have worshipped here and who have come at times of joy
and sorrow Pray if you will, that God wall continue to make this Church a centre of sanity in our
confused and unhappy world
THE RECTOR IS INDEBTED TO FORMER RECTOR ELLIOTT AND THE LATE
MR DAVID CRAINE FOR MUCH OF THESE NOTES.
