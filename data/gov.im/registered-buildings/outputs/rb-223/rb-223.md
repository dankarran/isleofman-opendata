REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: The Old Burtons Building
ADDRESS: (18a/20) Victoria Street, Douglas
POST CODE: IM1 2LE
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GRID REF: 382 754
History
Burtons Ltd
Established in 1900 by Sir Montague Burton (b. 1855-d. 1952) Burton’s grew from very
humble beginnings selling men’s ready-to-wear suits into a successful empire. By 1906 the
first chain of Burton’s shops had been established and by 1929 there were a total of 333
stores. Burton’s Hudson Road factory in Leeds became the largest clothing factory in Europe.
“The shops, which imitated the style of a gentleman’s club, were central to the whole
business. The shops’ design changed over time, but they were always instantly recognisable.”

Victoria Street
The properties date back to the 1870’s when Victoria Street was created as the latest
thoroughfare in Douglas. Victoria Street was designed in order to connect the developing
parts of the upper town with the sea terminal. It cut through the narrow streets of old Douglas,
much of which had to be demolished in the process. Duke Street contained much older
properties, which were cut through to allow Victoria Street to be built. Evidence of this can be
seen on the building on the corner opposite Burton’s, which has a Georgian elevation to
Dukes Street and a Victorian elevation to Victoria Street.
The property currently lies unoccupied after being used as an office equipment shop since
1987. Prior to that it was used as a carpet showroom. In 1943 plans were submitted and
approved to convert the first and second floors into a Y.M.C.A Centre.
Architectural Interest
Designed by architect Harry Wilson in 1929, this property is typical of the style of the
Burton’s buildings, which has been described as “always instantly recognisable”. The
original plans were initially submitted in 1927 and revised in 1929. It was a three-storey
building on a prime comer site. It is very much an Art Deco building, which was the modern
style of the twenties and thirties. The facade’s to Victoria Street and Duke street are in a white
faience style which was once commonplace in Douglas, but now there are few remaining
examples (the old Strand Cinema, the old Crescent Cmema). The faience style originated in
Chicago and came to the Isle of Man through Liverpool, which was the main importer from
Chicago. The design was fashionable in a lot of seaside towns.

The shopfront is separated from the upper floors by a large horizontal band, which is topped
with a cornice. This band has been further accentuated by later alterations to the shopfront
glazing. Above, the windows are arranged in long vertical bays, which span the two storeys
but which are separated by panels at floor level. The majority of the windows on each
elevation are highlighted with a decorative frame. The Duke Street and Victoria Street
elevations extend above the second floor to create a parapet wall, which are decorated with
stylised pediments.
Landmark Qualities
The building occupies a prime corner site on a busy street and it is a prominent feature in the
local landscape.
Group Value
Faience style facade’s can also be seen on other properties in Douglas including the old
Strand Cinema (currently a shop) and the old Crescent Cinema (currently a nightclub). The
style was once much more common in Douglas, and buildings of a similar style, which have
been demolished, include the Royalty Cinema and the Rendezvous café.
Age and Rarity
The building dates from 1929, which is not a significant age for a property when taken in the
context of this area of Douglas. Victoria Street dates from 1870’s and Duke Street the 1800’s.
Although the age of the property is not notable, the style is. This property is an excellent
example of the white faience style and one of the few remaining in Douglas of this design.
This style is unique in Victoria street which has a mix of Victorian and modem buildings.
Recommendation
This building is recommended for inclusion on the list of Registered Buildings particular!
because of its uniqueness and rarity within Douglas and the Island.
