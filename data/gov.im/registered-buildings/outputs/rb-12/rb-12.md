THE ISLE OF MAN
Bradda Hill (766 feet) lies to the south of Fleshwick
Bay, with fine rock scenery on the coastline:
Bradda Moor, or Grammah Hill, is the lofty moor-
land terminating in Bradda Head,
(KIRK) BRADDAN.—A civil and_ ecclesiastical
parish which formerly included the greater part of
Douglas, the area of the civil parish being 11,454 acres,
much of it highlands. The rateable value is £20,209.
In the neighbourhood of Douglas it contains many fine
mansions and villa residences, but the greater part of the
parish is devoted to agriculture.
The most interesting feature of Kirk Braddan is the
old parish church to which, it is safe to say, hundreds of
thousands of visitors to the Island have made pilgrimage.
Situated in the valley of the River Dhoo, about 2} m.
N.W. of Douglas, Old Kirk Braddan, overgrown with
ivy, stands among beautiful, lofty trees, and presents a
very picturesque appearance,
The structure in itself has no special architectural
attractions, excepting, perhaps, the tall, narrow doors
and Norman arched windows. The edifice consists
merely of a plain chancel and nave with a bell turret
at the W. end, but its position and surroundings are
ideal.
Old Kirk Braddan is named after, and dedicated to,
St. Brandon, an abbot, who, according to a tradition, of
which, however, there is no historic proof, became
Bishop of Man and the Isles in 1025. He died in the
Isle of Arran in 1066, and many churches were dedicated
to his memory.
The present church was rebuilt in 1773, so that it is
not as old as it looks, though there are indications that it
includes portions of an older structure, and the tower is
certainly older than the church.

(KIRK) BRADDAN
It is certain also’ that an earlier church existed on the
site, because there is direct evidence that Mark, Bishop
of the Isle, held a synod here, when thirty-five canons
were enacted, the text of which is still extant,
The existence of Celtic Christian crosses, along with
others of Scandinavian origin, is evidence that a keeill
occupied the site before the Norse invasion of the
Island.
‘Traces of Anglian workmanship in some of the later
crosses suggest the influence of the Church of Northum-
bria, in the gth century. 1
At the church may now be seen about a dozen crosses—
Celtic, Anglian, and Scandinavian—dating from the
6th to the rath century. The Scandinavian monuments
have runic inscriptions, but no scenes from Norse
mythology are depicted.
The following are perhaps the most interesting:
Cross patee (64).—In relief. (Celtic.)
Wheel-headed Cross (72).—Gives a conventional repre-
sentation of Daniel in the den of lions, with well-designed
interlaced work. (Anglian work, dating from the 9th
century.)
Thorstein’s Cross (112),—One face almost worn away;
the other shows ringchain-and-twist, and ring, with runic
inscription : “ Thorstein erected this cross to'the memory
of Ufeig son of Crina.” (Scand.) |
Thorleif’s Cross (135)—Cruciform, 7 feet high and
very beautiful, with runic inscription: “ Thorleif
Hnakki erected this cross to the memory of Fiace his son,
Brothers son to Haf.” (Scand.)
Odd’s Cross (136).—Broken shaft of pillar, very, similar
to Thorleif’s Cross.
George Borrow, who tramped the Island in, 1854, is
said to have discovered it in the tower of the church.

THE ‘ISLE OF MAN
The''rulnié ‘inscription reads}: Odd raised this cross
to his father Frakki but Thorbjorn » . .”” (Scand.)
The Roskitil Cross (138)-is a fragment, with the inscrip-
tion running up the shaft and head, and finishing on
the left, What now remains reads: . . .“¢ But Hross-
ketil betrayed [him] in a truce his own oath-fellow.”
(Scand.)
The church plate of Old Kirk Braddan included a
silver tankard of 1675.’
“Inside, near the pulpit, is a mural tablet to the memory
of John Kelly, LL.D., a native of the parish, and a great
Gaelic scholar. (See ‘ Celebrities.”’)
‘Interesting memotials in the churchyard’ are the
following :' !
‘An obelisk near the tower marks the grave of Licut-
Colonel Lord Henry Murray, fifth son of the Duke of
Atholl .(d. 1805), erected by the rofficers of the Royal
Manx Fencibles.
Not! far away is a memorial to Honey Hutchinson,
brother-in-law and cousin ofthe poet Wordsworth, who
is the‘author of the inscription !
Ue! |GAtvah early age he entered upon a sea-faring life,
+1 in'the. course of which, being ofa. thoughtful mind,
i he attained gréat skill and knowledge of his Pro-
fession, and enduredin all climates severe hardships
{,, {With exemplary. courage and fortitude. The latter
teebeys jpart of his life was passed with'a beloyed sister upon
» this Island. He died at Douglas the 23rd of May,
1839, much laniented by his Kindred and Friends,
who have erected this stone to testify their sense of
“his mild virtues and humble piety. ;

He was father of two famous sons, T. I, Brown, the
Manx poet, and Hugh Stowell Brown, the great preacher,
of Liverpool. (Sce ‘ Celebrities.)
“The learned Philip Moore,” a native of the parish,
who had been Master of Douglas Grammar School, and
Rector of Kirk Bride, also a leading authority on Manx
Gaelic (d. 1783), has the following inscription on his
headstone :
For ever may the man be blest
Who never will these bones molest,
But here for ever let them rest,
‘Till fire consume this Earthly Ball
And Christ shall come to judge us all.
Situ felix semper ita
Et fruaris dui vita.
Near the east gate is the grave of Dr, Oswald, author
of Vestigia and other important works bearing on anti-
quarian subjects; and close to the south door of the
church, a tombstone which has attracted attention on
account of its peculiar inscription:
Here underlyeth the body of Patrick Thompson®
Minister of God’s Word forty years, at present Vicar
of Kirk Braddan: aged sixty seven, anno 1678.
Deceased ye 24th of April, anno 1689.
The church, which is usually open to the inspection
of visitors, is not used for public service except on special
occasions, such as when Archdeacon Kewley preaches
in the Manx language. But on Sunday mornings during
the visiting season enormous congregations, ranging
from 10,000 to over 20,000, attend the open-air service
held near the churchyard, the vicar usually standing

on the Drury stone, which commemorates the institution
of these'services by the late “ Parson” Drury, a former
vicar, and an extremely popular preacher in the Island.
In addition to the literary associations referred to,
the church was visited by Hawthorne, the American
writer, and eulogized in his ‘ Note Book,” while T. E.
Brown has a poem on “ Braddan Vicarage” and many
other allusions to the place,
Kirk Braddan may be reached (1) by following Peel
Road from Douglas railway station 1} m, to the Quarter
Bridge—there bearing to the left and taking the road
opposite running parallel with the railway. The two
churches, Old and New Kirk Braddan, will then be seen
on the left.
(2) By public footpath through the grounds of the
Nunnery (q.v-), passing under Castletown railway, walking
to Castletown New Road, crossing this road, and going
along the Saddle Road.
(3) On Sunday mornings, by special trains leaving
Douglas at 10, to a temporary station near the church,
or by car from the Promenade,
New Kirk Braddan, erected 1880, is of E.E. style
and one of the finest churches in the Island, accommo-
dating about 1,000 people. A spire to the church has
been twice blown down.
Between the Old and the New churches there was
till recently a little wood containing a number of weather-
worn blocks of stone, some in an upright position. This:
is thought to be the site of a prehistoric camp and burial
ground,
Braddan Cemetery, near Port-y-Shee (q.v.), is notable
as the burial place of John Martin (d. 1854), the famous
painter of The Last Judgment, Fall of Babylon, Belshaz-
zar’s Feast, The Plains of Heaven, ete.
