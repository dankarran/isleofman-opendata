Register entry description 
 
History 
 
Until 1994, Ballavarry Farm had been in the same family ownership, through marriage, since 
the 16th century Manorial Roll. The Allen Family that owned the property between 1737 and 
1994 have a significance in the social history of the north of the island, with the family 
including vicars of Maughold Church, curates of Andreas Church, MHKs and Captain of Andreas 
Parish. 
 
The existing farmhouse is a multiphase dwelling dating from 18th Century. The 5 bay 
farmhouse with rear staircase projection is described in a document from 1762 when their 
ownership was settled from mother to daughter. The two bay northerly extensions of the main 
house date from the mid-19th Century, and is present on maps from the 1860s.
