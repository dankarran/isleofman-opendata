St. German’s Cathedral, Peel
St. German’s Cathedral, Peel was designed by architects Messrs Thomas Barry &
Sons of Liverpool and constructed of local red sand stone and natural Welsh slate.
The foundation stone of the cathedral was laid on 21 August 1879 and the cathedral
was completed by 1883. The cathedral, of gothic style is of cruciform shape with an
aisle on either side, with north and south transepts and two vestries at the east end.
The clock and bell tower on the north elevation contain the main entrance, with a
second entrance on the south side. In 1884 a peel of eight bells was installed in the
tower.
A severe gale in February 1903 caused extensive damage, the roof was stripped and
the timber collapsed dropping into the central part and north aisle of the nave, the
west gable was damaged, pews and a window were destroyed. Reparations cost
£3,000. Following this in 1906, the spire and tower were removed due to instability,
the tower was rebuilt using the original stones.
The exterior sandstone walls are 2 foot 6 inches thick and those of the tower are 5 foot
thick. These remain in largely good condition with the exception of some weathering.
Some repointing was carried out in 1988, and major repointing of the tower cost
£21,000. The roof, of natural slate on battens, rafters and softwood trusses under went
some reslating in 1993; the North and South aisles, North transept, Choir Vestry,
Flower room, Vicar’s vestry and south porch. Alongside the reslating, the original
cast iron guttering was replaced with Aluminium.
The boundary walls of the Cathedral are mainly cast iron and sand stone, with the east
boundary being an irregular sod hedge. Half of the south wall has been completely

rebuilt while half remains in poor condition. The cathedral is accessible through two
gates, and has large drive areas and the west entrance path has recently been
resurfaced, The churchyard contains a war memorial to the west of the Cathedral.
Entrance to the church is through a recently constructed second porch featuring Celtic
etched glass motifs and the coat of arms of the diocese. The ceilings forming part of
the roof structure are pine boarded or plain lath and plaster. The floor is timber, with
the nave flooring most recently renewed in1988 due to woodworm. The roof of the
nave is supported by a series of five compound scissor {russes which come down to
corbels on the walls, with A frames in between. The aisles on either side of the Nave
are divided by an arcade of four pointed arches. The font made of Caen stone is
supported by a central pillar and is surrounded by four others of red and black granite.
The supporting columns of hard Cheshire red sandstone are circular and octagonal in
section. The north transept leads to the vestry area, the north wall of this houses a
chair once belonging to Bishop Rowley Hill. The walls within the tower are plain
brickwork, with new floors and ceilings recently fitted. Galvanised steel bell frames
have been fitted with the timber frames remaining.
The west window is the most striking of the stained glass designs, this features the
Nativity of our Lord, which replaced a window depicting the House at Bethany which
was destroyed in the 1903 storm. Other windows include a series of seven windows in
the aisles depicting the life of our Lord which commemorates seven post-Reformation
Bishops, a depiction of the judgement of Soloman, a memorial to Robert John Moore,
a former high Bailiff of Peel and a scene inspired by Holman Hunt’s picture “The
Light of the World’. All of the windows are protected by polycarbonate sheeting.

The interior of the cathedral houses many features of much interest. The wall to the
west of the porch features two fragments of stone, one which came from the Cathedral
of Nidaros in Norway brought over by Odin’s Raven on July Sth, 1979 and one from
the Old Cathedral of Peel. The cathedral houses artefacts of Manx historical
importance such as portraits, a chair and escritoire cabinet belonging to the late
Bishop Thomas Wilson, The west area of the cathedral has been set aside for
exhibitions of diocese objects. The choir stalls which were installed in 1935, and
feature individual carved poppy designs. A communion table made of light oak is
decorated with a Celtic ring chain pattern.
