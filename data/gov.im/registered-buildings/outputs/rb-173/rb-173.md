CENTRAL HOTEL,
Broadway,
Douglas.
Background
The Central Hotel, Broadway was one of the buildings which appeared on a list
produced and submitted as part of the information supplied to the Public Enquiry into
the Revision of the Douglas Local Plan, in June, 1997. Part of the grounds for its
inclusion at this time lay in the fact that many significant Victorian buildings which had
added so much to the character of, not only the promenades, but Douglas as a whole,
had been demolished in recent years. With the loss of buildings such as The Villiers, the
Masonic Hall and its adjoining properties, the Palace Ballroom (the Lido) and other
lengthy sections of the promenades, the merits of those buildings which remain become
enhanced and take on a more important status, by virtue of their survival, than they
might otherwise have done. It is accordingly of increasing importance that the surviving
buildings which are considered to be of architectural or historic interest should be
protected by Registration.
Historical notes
The Central Hotel is located in a very prominent position in the most significant natural
break in the brows which frame Douglas Bay. Fronitime immemorial, Broadway was
the route by which the farmers of Ballaquayle hauled sea wrack from the Douglas shore
to spread on their fields. When the Duke of Athol acquired the Ballaquayle Estate and
decided to build for himself, the Castle Mona, he caused a fine driveway to be

°
constructed leading from Broadway, running parallel with the beach for approximately
six hundred yards to access his new residence. Flanking the entrance to the Drive he
constructed a pair of gate lodges, one of which became the “Castle Tap” public house
and which eventually provided part of the site for the present Central Hotel.
On the 1“ September. 1887 Douglas Corporation granted approval for the layout of
plots for Boarding Houses on land off Broadway: the layout of plots was undertaken by
W. J. Rennison, Architect of Villiers Chambers. The design for the Central was the
subject of a design competition which was advertised in The Builder on 26" November,
1887 on behalf of Mr. Louis Kelly, Builder of Douglas.
The prize for the winning entry was awarded to one Mr. A Pennington of Southport and
Ramsey and I have found no evidence to tell us whether or not the design executed had
changed significantly from the winning entry.
The principal elevation of the building addresses the Broadway frontage; the side
elevation which now faces onto the promenade did, of course, originally front on to
Castle Mona Avenue prior to the demolition, in the 1960/70’s, of the building shown as
a café on earlier photographs,
Even prior to the demolition of so many other buildings on the promenade, the Central
Hotel has been, and stil! remains, one of the most striking buildings along the whole of
the Douglas sea front. Several factors contribute to its architectural quality and
distinguish it from others:- ,
the use of red Ruabon brickwork combines with decorative terracotta and lime stucco of
a high quality to form a most striking composition;
nN

© features such as curved bow windows and splayed bays add interest and bring about
sense of scale and order to the Broadway elevation;
e this sense of order is enhanced by the external demarcation of floor levels being
expressed in horizontal string courses;
® the pattern of fenestration on the promenade elevation also achieves a pleasing sense of
order with windows at ground floor level grouped symmetrically around a central
doorway and at upper levels groups of windows are arranged in pairs and adopt a
variety of window head treatments all of which add a distinct and almost playful
appearance to this building so typical of Victorian Seaside Architecture.
e the building occupies a dominant position and uses its comer site appropriately well
advertising its presence to all who approach, even from a distance.
Another important feature in the building’s appearance and history is the removal
(probably in the early 1920’s as the present entrance is shown “as existing” in drawings
submitted in 1925) of a third curved bow window feature from the extreme left hand
side as viewed from Broadway, and its replacement with the existing Portico in the Art
Deco Stvle. This gives a clue to the re-modelling which has taken place in part of the
interior: the main staircase to the first floor is a later re-arrangement with a 1920’s style
lift to convey visitors to the upper levels of the hotel. The main lounge at first floor
level has been also remodelled in the spirit of ArtDeco, with sheet marble panels and a
replacement fireplace fitted. Although the style of this room may not appeal to all tastes,
it marks a part of the changing history of the building and should be recognised and
respected as such. toe
Architect Mr. W. J. Rennison may have had a hand in the final design, but I have found
no conclusive proof to that effect, save for the fact that his name appears upon the
application form for Bye-Law approval: however the plans which accompanied the

application were not to be found at the time of my enquiry. Rennison did practice with
Pennington for some time and if, in fact, the building is a Rennison work, this would
add to the grounds for Registration when set against the fact that we have lost several
Rennison works in recent years.
From the mid 1890's the use of Ruabon Brick became very popular in the Isle of Man.
This is a hard-baked. resilient, smooth-faced brick imported from Ruabon in Wales and
although there are other examples of the use of this material within Douglas, none is
used with quite the same style or distinction as we see in this building combined with
highly decorative terracotta and lime stucco work as seen for example in the corner
panel clearly visible in its second floor corner position; clever use of curved bow
windows and splayed bay windows are all features which add to the internal qualities
of the building and take advantage of the fine views across Douglas Bay.
The building has over the years lost some of its attractive features with the removal of
the three roof towers and the substitution of a mansard type of roof form in place of the
original, steeply pitched roof with its oval shaped dormers. However, it may be said that
none of these alterations or removals is irreversible and any proposed re-use of the
building would encourage the restoration of the original roof form.
An application to the Town Surveyor’s Department for the addition of a new Smoke
room and Billiard Room was lodged by Mr. Edward Forrest, Architect and Surveyor of
Athol Street, Douglas and approved on 31“ March, 1897. From an internal inspection
and from the drawings lodged of the building, it is clear that this extension provided
superior accommodation for the playing of billiards in a large first floor room with
seating around the perimeter walls and large roof lights to provide natural daylight from
above. The roof structure is attractive and was designed to be seen, featuring substantial
King Post trusses. which are well wrought and are at present just visible through a hatch
in the later, lower ceiling construction.

Finally, the addition of the “Balcony Bar” in the 1960’s was the last major addition to
the hotel, but any future proposals for the building would be encouraged to remove,
alter or modify this aspect, which although again provides a record of the historical
development of the building, it does not respond sympathetically to the initial design
concept, nor complement or enhance the building.
The Central Hotel now represents one of the few examples of Victorian architecture’s
fully developed response to the requirements of the rapidly expanding tourist industry
in the Isle of Man at the approach to the last turn of the century. The building shows a
confident use of a wide architectural vocabulary and materials resulting (despite
unfortunate losses and alterations) in a building of considerable architectural merit and
aesthetic quality which is now a well known land mark on the streetscape of the Town
of Douglas.
The Central Hotel, Broadway, Douglas is entered into the Protected Buildings
Register on the following grounds:-
the building in its prominent position makes a major contribution to the
streetscape of the Island’s Capital by virtue of its aesthetic quality and
particularly the high standard of decorative terracotta and lime stucco work to be
seen on the Promenade and Broadway elevations;
the building is one of the few remaining examples of High Victorian Architecture
in an Hotel built to accommodate the rapidly expanding tourist industry in the Isle
of Man at the end of the last century: as such the building represents an important
element in the historical and sociological development of Douglas.
