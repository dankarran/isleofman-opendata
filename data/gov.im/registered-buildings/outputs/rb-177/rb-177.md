ERIN BRAE, QUEEN’S PROMENADE, DOUGLAS
In October 1822 Robert Richards conveyed to The Duke of Athol a new dwelling house
which had been built upon land purchased by Richards in 1821. The Duke retained ownership
of the house, now known as “Erin Brae”, until he sold it on, along with two cottages, in
August 1830 to Francis Whitfield who, in due course, conveyed the same to John Anderson.
By December 1847, we find John Anderson selling to the Rev. Peter Toler who then, in
September 1851 conveyed:
“All and singular a certain dwelling house, garden and premises situate at the crescent
in the Parish of Onchan ... and which dwelling house lands and premises with the
measurements and boundaries thereof are more particularly laid out and extend on the
plan hereto annexed ...
Also all and singular a certain potion of that enclosed land situate between the said
highroad leading from Douglas to Onchan and the seashore and commonly called the
Green.”
Tradition has it that the property was used by the Duke of Athol as a house of “Grace and
Favour” and it is not difficult to imagine quite splendid receptions being held in the elegant
surroundings of the first floor “piano nobile”. The property is among the very oldest
surviving buildings along the whole length of the Promenades, the main corpus dating from
the Georgian period and with the disappearance during recent years, of so many promenade
buildings, the survival of this building becomes even more important. The house would
formerly have been flat-fronted and of 3-bay design (see sketch A) with, until their removal
in recent years, high quality decorative cast and wrought iron balconies located above the
lower string course at first floor level. These were removed because of their dangerous
condition, but I understand were of a pattern similar to those to be seen at The Queen’s Hotel
which is adjacent to Erin Brae. The property would certainly have had small paned Georgian,
3 on 6, or 6 on 6 vertical sliding sash windows, with possible Regency Style “French
Windows” at balcony level. The present 3-storey projecting bay to the front elevation is
characteristic of a Victoria addition. There is every likelihood that the original small-paned

windows would be replaced at this time, to take advantage of the new availability of “floated”
glass, giving use the present style of two-paned sliding sashes.
The property retains curved console brackets supporting arched pediments to two of the first
floor windows and these in themselves are an original features which are noteworthy are the
fine cast and wrought iron double entrance gates which, for their age, are in very good
condition and feature Athemion and Plamette motifs so typical of the Georgian period.
Internally, there still remains some fine quality decorative plaster work, notably the vaulted
ceiling in the rear entrance hall and the intricately modelled plaster cornice in the first floor
reception rooms.
Erin Brae has alternated in use between a hotel and a private house and has stood as a
detached house long before the intensive development of the promenades during the Victorian
period. At one time the property included “the Bath House, Coach House and Stable” erected
on the Green, however, during 1888, several conveyances of property in the area of The
Crescent took place between the various individual owners of properties, the Douglas
Commissioners and the Isle of Man Tramways Ltd, with a view to building a sea wall and for
the laying out of all the land lying the East of the highway between McCrones slip and Derby
Castle. It was also at this time that plans were laid down for the construction of a double line
of tram rail up to the gate of Derby Castle. Accordingly, the land across the road which
belonged to Erin Brae was absorbed in to the main scheme of things.
In recent years the property has reverted to its use as an hotel and the present owners have
been able to improve the facilities without irreversibly damaging the aesthetic quality of the
building. Erin Brae is entered into the Protected Buildings Register on the following
grounds:-
1. Its historical association with the Duke of Athol.
2. Its aesthetic quality and architectural merit.
3. Age and rarity - being constructed in 1821-22, this building is one of the oldest
surviving, detached buildings along the length of the Promenades.
