REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Castletown Railway Station
ADDRESS: Victoria Road, Castletown
POST CODE: IM9 1EE
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Castletown Commissioners
GRID REF: 268 679
Introduction
The Douglas to Port Erin railway opened to the public on the 1* August 1874, one year after
the Douglas to Peel Jine opened. Originally, Castletown Station was to e situated on Malew
Road, some distance from the town. Residents were not pleased with this, and it was agreed
that the station could be moved to its current location providing that the connecting road ‘would
be formed by the Memorialists’.
Towards the end of the construction period, stringent economies were necessary to allow the
line to be completed. The station list, dated October 1872, provided for all station buildings on
the line to be of wooden structure, and Castletown was to be provided with a third class
station. This was in contrast to Douglas, where a first class station was to be provided, and
Port Erin where there was to be a second class station.
It is likely that some time between October 1872 and the opening of the railway in 1874, the
question of stations was re-examined. It would appear that he two stations for Castletown and
Port Erin were originally constructed in stone, and they were later described as ‘permanent’. An
early photograph of the first Port Erin station shoes it Is to be very similar in appearance to
Castletown. Some commentators’ state that Castletown originally had a wooden station, but it
is considered this is improbable, and that the stone station that exists today was for the most
part constructed around 1874. It is unlikely that the station was completed in time for the
opening, as it was only at a board meeting on 9" March 1874 that the final position for the
station was approved.
Following the success of the line, a programme of station-building replacement was
commenced. The first station to be rebuilt was Douglas, where in 1891 the timber station was
replaced with a building in Ruabon brick. Port St Mary followed in 1998, and Port Erin in
1903/1904, with an extension being added in 1911. These three stations, on the Douglas to
Port Erin line, have an important common factor in that they are all constructed in ref Ruabon

brick. Douglas was designed by James Cowle, whilst George Kay was responsible for Port St
Mary and Port Erin.
It was decided in 1901 that the Castletown station would be renovated, and in 1902 J W Corrin
was engaged to erect a wooden veranda that carried a balcony on eight pillars, the cost being
£134. it Castletown had been provided with a timber station, as was originally proposed, it is
considered highly unlikely that its stone successor would have required refurbishment and
extension when there is only a twenty-eight-year period between 1874 and 1902.
Furthermore, Castletown station shows none of the characteristics of the three stations
mentioned above that were replaced around the turn of the century, and it is therefore on
balance considered that Castletown was built as a stone station around 1874, and that the
building we see today is largely original, This conclusion is backed up by reference to the
photograph of the first Port Erin Station, which bears a striking resemblance to the Castletown
picture taken in 1950, before the over-detailed woodwork to the barge and facia boards was
fitted.
James I C Boyd stated that in 1902: ‘The station building, (saved from demolition), was given a
wooden veranda at the front to increase its covered accommodation’. Ian MacNab wrote
‘Castletown still retains its original station’.
It was also in 1901, that Cannel and Corrin of Castletown were engaged to build a new goods
shed at a cost of £297 12s Od, to replace the original building of 1881, which had become too
small.
It is not clear what works the 1902 renovations included, as there are no plans available and all
photographs post-date this period. The enlargement of the operation at Castletown station was
probably due to Castletown being the second most important station on the line. The seat of
Government had only moved from Castletown to Douglas in 1869, five years prior to the line
opening, and Castletown stiil had a busy harbour, the brewery and gas works, all of which were
transporting goods by rail.
It would appear the building, prior to an addition on the rear to extend the toilet areas, was
symmetrical and is built in the Gothic-style with twin gables. Construction is in dressed
carboniferous limestone blocks from Scarlett Point. It has a pitched roof clad in slate, The
building has two chimneys, the southern most of which has been increased in height in recent
years. The property has timber windows, all of which have been replaced, and some cast iron
and some PVC rainwater goods.
In 1993, the building was again refurbished. These works were extensive and included removal
of the 1902 canopy and balcony, to return the building to a more original appearance. The roof
was replaced, and new highly-detailed barge and fascia boards fitted. The toilet areas were
remodelled, this involved creating new ladies and gentlemen’s toilets from the area previously
occupied by the ladies’ toilets and this was done by providing rear extensions with flat roofs.
Today the building has two distinct areas, to the West is the Station Master’s/Ticket Office,
which was divided in 1993 to also provide a general-purpose room. It contains fittings that
either could be origina! or date form the 1902 refurbishment. These include panelling,

counter/desk unit and ticket hatch. There is a covered central area, which previously had
windows at the rear elevation of this area, render has been trowelled to imitate the adjacent
stonework. To the eastern side of this covered area is the waiting room. In 1993, the rear
door was reduced in size to form a window opening, and the doorway to the toilet area was
reopened. The station was provided with raised platforms in 1995.
The goods shed is built in random stone, with red brick quoins and string courses, under a
pitched slate roof. It has opening doors to both east and west elevations allowing a train to pull
through. Three windows track side have been boarded over, On the western elevation, is a
loading door with canopy over. A similar door on the rear (south) elevation has been sealed, as
has an opening on the eastern elevation. Internally, there is a raised platform adjacent to the
tracks, and the original external goods platform remains in position.
The goods shed could be enhanced by removal of, or rendering over the breeze-blocks that are
currently blocking a former aperture on the eastern elevation.
Castletown Railway Station is considered worthy of addition to the Protected Buildings Register
by reason of the following:
Architectural Interest and / or Aesthetic Quality:
Whilst Douglas, Port Erin and Port St Mary were all reconstructed in Ruabon brick, Castletown is
understood to be the only remaining station built in the focal limestone.
Historic Interest:
Its association with the growth of commerce across the Island associated with the expansion of
the railway to the Isle of Man.
Age and Rarity:
As it is considered to be the only remaining original stone constructed station on the Douglas to
Port Erin Line
