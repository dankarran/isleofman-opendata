REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Elderbank
ADDRESS: The Crofts, Castletown
POST CODE: IM9 1LW
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Castletown Commissioners
GRID REF: 262 675
Introduction
Following the purchase by the British crown of the rights of the Duke of Athol in 1828, the
Lord's or Governor's Garden was sold by the Department of Woods and Forests to Thomas
Brine on the 7 August 1835. Brine paid £300 for the land, which was described as ‘A parcel of
garden-ground in Castletown of unenciosed land lying between the garden-ground and the new
road to Malew Street’. Thomas Brine was a notable architect on the Isle of Man, and died in an
accident in Castletown Square in 1840. Westwood was built in the early 1840's on part of the
land he purchased.
Thomas Brine’s widow, Ann, sold the remainder of the farid in two parcels. The first in 1853 ~
this being only a single plot for the erection of one of the terrace houses on Arbory Street, the
remainder of the land was sold to Flaxney Stowell on the 8" November 1855. The land
purchased by Stowell included the site of Elderbank, and a large plot fronting the Arbory Street
on which is now erected the former doctors’ surgery, the former Town Hail, and numbers 38-42
Arbory Street.
It is not possible to be absolutely certain when Elderbank was built, but by the 1861 census
Flaxney Stowell, his wife and brother-in-law were noted to be living on Arbory Street adjacent
to the Town Hall. At that point in time, Elderbank, whilst facing the Crofts, was accessed from
Arbory Street and therefore had an Arbory Street address. It is believed the address was
changed to The Crofts when the property was altered and extended in 1909.
In an account written around 1950, W H Cooper (1870 — 1960) states: ‘Elderbank was built by
Mr Stowell snr, for himself, wife and brother-in-law. It was originally only a small house. When
Mr Flaxney the second inherited it, he added to it by using up part of the workshop, making a
kitchen and scullery on the ground floor and bedroom and bathroom on the first floor, and
stairs to the attic’.
It has previously been assumed that Elderbank was built around the same time at Westwood,
and could have been designed by Brine. The current owners of Elderbank discovered a piece of
wood, which carries an inscription that the house was built in 1839 and extended 1909, this
inscription is signed F Stowell. Due to the fact that Flaxney Stowell didn’t purchase the land

until 1855, it is assumed that there is an error in this inscription. Flaxney Stowell was born in
1814, and it is considered unlikely that he would have built a house such as Elderbank at the
age of only 25.
The 1851 census reveals Stowell to be living in Hope Street, whereas in 1861 he was living
adjacent to the Town Hall at Elderbank.
On the plan accompanying the deed of sale for the single house plot in 1853, the site is also
shown undeveloped, whilst Westwood is shown to be already built.
Flaxney Stowell died in 1908 at Elderbank and the property was left to his nephew, Flaxney
Stowell (2), a painter and decorator. Following his death and that of his widow, Agnes Eleanor
Stowell, the property passed to their son, Flaxney Stowell (3) in 1933. On the death of Flaxney
Stowell (3) in 1944, Eleanor Annie Stowell, his widow, inherited the property.
After almost one hundred years in the Stowell family, Elderbank was sold in November 1949 to
Ramsey Lee Quayle. Mrs Stowell retained the shop, which was recently the doctors’ surgery,
and the jand to the rear. She sold this retained portion in 1960 to Ralph Varden. In 1963,
Doctor Robert Fred Jackson purchased the shop and fand from Ralph Varden, and Elderbank
from Ramsey Lee Quayle, re-uniting the property. He held the property until 1973, when he
sold Elderbank and most of the land to the rear, but not the doctors’ surgery, to Elisabeth
Martha Maria Desselberger from Berlin. The property has been sold recently by Mrs
Desselberger to Mr and Mrs McGowan.
As Cooper stated, the original Elderbank was a very small house indeed. It is built in local
limestone, with slate lintols, and is currently arranged mainly over two floors, but now has two
second-floor bedrooms that were not part of the original construction. It would appear that the
original house had two small ground-floor rooms to either side of a central hallway, and two
bedrooms (one to either side of the landing) at first-floor level. This original footprint has been
greatly extended with a large two-storey rear extension, which provides a dining room at
ground-floor level with a bedroom and bathroom above, but more importantly facilitates access
to the second floor by the inclusion of a staircase.
Consideration has been given as to whether the hall, stairs and landing of the property that we
see today are original, as they are such a fine feature to be included in a relatively modest
house. Whilst a definitive answer cannot be given, a pointer that they are original is given by
the inclusion of simple square spindies to the main staircase, whilst the secondary staircase that
accesses the second floor contains polished and turned hardwood spindles. It would seem very
unlikely to include a far superior spindie in a staircase that will rarely been seen, than in the one
which is probably the main feature of the property and will be seen by everyone who walks
through the front door.
The extended Elderbank that we see today is somewhat disjointed, and whilst it is undoubtedly
a large house, it retains the narrow reception rooms and bedrooms that were part of the
original dwelling.
The room to the original property is pitched front to back, and clad in slate. This roof is pierced
by the three-storey tower section of the property, the roof is pierced by the three-storey tower

(pes

section of the property, the roof of which is also pitched in the opposite direction and clad in
slate. The eaves overhang to the property is extensively detailed, as are the bargeboards and
fascias. The property features fine chimney pots, one of the original two chimney stacks has
now been cement rendered. .
The large two-storey rear extension is cement rendered, and there is a single-storey side
projection, which according to Cooper was originally a workshop, but now houses the kitchen
and garage. To the rear of the property there is a lean-to rear porch and toilet extension, and
a large conservatory area that was built in 1993. In the small area of rear garden is a guest
suite, which is an unfortunate piece or architecture. It is a white rendered flat-roofed structure
that is considered completely out of context with its surroundings.
How Elderbank has evolved cannot be categorically defined, but it would appear that the two
ground-floor reception rooms to the front of the property, each with a bedroom above, were
part of the original structure, as were the hall, staircase and landing that we see today. It
appears likely that there has always been a small front and rear projection in the property's
footprint, and this is borne out by the 1869 Ordnance Survey map. It is clear the second floor
to the property could not have been added before the large two-storey rear extension was built,
as the staircase accessing the second floor is contained within this extension.
One unsolved mystery is that of the smaller of the two original bedrooms. This room does not
extend to the back of the original structure, and due to the slope of the staircase, the area,
which is now a bathroom, could not have been accessed from any other point on the landing or
half-landing. It may well be that this bedroom was reduced in size when the property was
remodelled, and part of the rear of this bedroom used for a second bathroom and to house and
staircase to the second floor.
AS stated above, undoubtedly the most interesting and remarkable feature of Elderbank is the
hail, staircase and landing. The entrance hail is accessed through a heavy front door that
appears original. The hallway has a timber dado with carved arched panelling below. The
doors to the reception rooms to either side of the entrance hall have what appear to be original
door furniture and joinery, with interesting four-panelled doors, the upper panels being arched.
The doorjambs and heads to these two rooms are panelled. The centrally situated staircase
has elaborately carved hardwood newels, hardwood handrails to both sides, and simple square
spindles. There are carved stings to both sides of the staircase, which are highly visible due to
the galleried landing that separates at half-landing level.
There is a simple moulded cornice in the entrance hall, but on the landing the plasterwork is
very elaborate. Both of the original first-floor bedrooms appear to retain their original doors
and architraves, Skirting boards throughout the property are in torus pattern, being deeper
within the entrance hall than the reception rooms. There are moulded cornices to both ground-
floor reception rooms, and whilst these are attractive, they are by no means as elaborate as
that on the first-floor landing.
Some windows to the earliest part of the property may well be original, certainly on the smaller
of the two bedrooms, mouldings appear too sharp to be original and may well be a later
replacement.
Author: 8. Moore. Building Conservation Officer 5 18" March 2008

At attic level, there are two bedrooms, one to the front of the property and one to the rear. To
either side there are extensive eaves-storage areas within the roof space of the original
property and in that of the later extension to the rear.
Whilst it is considered most likely that the second floor of the property was added in the early (
twentieth century, the same may also be true of the front-facing central window at first-floor ad
level, and again the mouldings on this window appear too sharp to be original. At half-landing
level on staircase, a small two-storey extension is passed through to gain access on the main
two-storey rear extension. The first of these extensions features decorative pillars and an
archway through the rear main structural wall of the property onto a small fanding area, which
is now uPVC double-glazed. One turns left to access the staircase to the second floor and the
remaining first-floor accommodation.
From various planning applications that have been inspected, it appears that Elderbank has
always had a rising dampness problem, and this remains today. At ground-floor level, main
walls are stained with rising dampness, and penetrating dampness is affecting the elaborate
cornice plasterwork to the landing at first-floor level. It would appear that the property was not
used as a main home for a considerable period of time.
Elderbank, The Crofts, Castletown is considered worthy of addition to the Protected Buildings
Register by reason of the following:
Architectural Interest and / or Aesthetic Quality:
Particularly for the quality of the design and craftsmanship of the main staircase and plaster
mouldings to the Hallway, Staircase and Landing.
