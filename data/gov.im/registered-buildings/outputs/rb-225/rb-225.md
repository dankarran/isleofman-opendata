REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
ADDRESS: 22, 24 and 26 Victoria Street, Douglas.
POST CODE: IM1 2LE
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GRID REF: 381 754
History
The properties date back to the 1870’s when Victoria Street was created as the latest
thoroughfare in Douglas. Victoria Street was designed in order to connect the developing
parts of the upper town with the sea terminal. It cut through the narrow streets of old Douglas,
much of which had to be demolished in the process.
Architectural Interest
Exterior
Numbers 22, 24 and 26 Victoria Street, Douglas are three fine examples of high Victorian
architecture with elevations modelled above Ground Floor in Italianate detailing. In terms of
the streetscape and in comparison with its neighbours, the facades are generally of higher
quality than their neighbours of the same period.
Flat pilasters with a raised central panel divide the overall street frontage into individual
building bays, which in conjunction with the ornate fenestration to First and Second Floor
bestow a strong vertical emphasis. The plain stringcourse between Ground and First floor
level and an ornate cornice line above Second Floor enriched with dentil bracketry, provide
the classical base, middle and top.
The painted timber sliding sash windows are grouped in threes in the raised render panel. The
window surrounds are ornately modelled with fluted pilasters from which spring embossed
roman arches to the First Floor and shallower arches to the Second Floor. Each arch head is
in turn capped with a keystone.
The masonry remains of the faux balconies held aloft by scrolled brackets and now sadly
missing their ironwork, project from the fagade between First and Second Floor.
The Third Floor is set behind an elaborate pierced parapet punctured by a pair of round arched
headed dormers continuing the vertical emphasis of the building to roof level.
No. 22 retains the same architectural treatment as its taller neighbours although in a two-
window format, but steps down. This has the effect of terminating the terrace and enabling the
terrace to turn the corner further enunciated by chamfering the fagade.
Due to the fact that the properties in question are relatively old, original drawings have not
been found. There are many other properties on Victoria Street with a similar style and many
others with the same cornicing detail. The cornicing design appears to have once continued
over the whole length of the street.

Several Victorian buildings have been replaced with modern buildings on Victoria Street and
the balance of Victorian Buildings to modern buildings is about 80% to 20%. However the
majority of the modern buildings are much larger and have a greater impact on the streetscape
than the ratio suggests.
Landmark Qualities
Although the properties are not landmarks in their own rights, they are an important part of
the streetscape and their removal would harm the character of the area.
Group Value
When Victoria Street was first created in the 1870’s these properties were built as a group in
the original style of the street.
Age and Rarity
The age of the buildings is appropriate for this area of Douglas as there was much
development here in the late 19" century, around the time when Douglas became the Island’s
capital.
Recommendation
This buildings are recommended for inclusion on the list of Registered Buildings particularly
for their architectural interest, that is to say, the quality of their facade and the contribution the
buildings make to the group value of Victoria Street.
