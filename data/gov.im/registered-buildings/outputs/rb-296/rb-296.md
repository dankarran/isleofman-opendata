Register entry description 
 
History 
 
The Trafalgar Inn first appears in the 1852 Slater’s trade directory although it is possible that 
the building had been previously known as the South Quay Tavern. 
 
The building itself possibly predates its use as a Public House, as the land on which the 
building sits was sold off from the nunnery estate in the early 19th century. 
 
The Trafalgar continued in use as a public house until 2010 and has since been used as a 
single dwelling. 
 
The Trafalgar is one of the few remaining buildings on the South Quay from the time when 
Douglas Harbour was a busy industrial port with strong trading connections to Liverpool. It is a 
surviving remnant of the 19th century expanding port and its associated activity and commerce 
and the industrial families that were involved in the growth of Douglas.
