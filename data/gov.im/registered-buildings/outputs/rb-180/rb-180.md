PORT SODERICK STATION BUILDING
Historical Notes
Introduction
A railway was first muted, for the Island, in the 1840’s when internal transport was still
fairly primitive. However, it was not until 1865 that a short-lived Isle of Man Railway
Company came into being; even though it was only in name . Finally in December
1870, the |.o.M Railway Co. Ltd was registered with the purpose of connecting the four
main towns of Douglas, Castletown, Peel and Ramsey; with an understanding that, at
some point in the future, the southern line would extend to the new harbour
development in Port Erin. Initially, Port Soderick, or Ballashamrock as it was first
named, was only planning to be a stopping point - so no passenger facilities were
considered necessary. Somewhat surprisingly the Company only recognised how
important the halt was after the line was opened; and it was the popularity of Port
Soderick Cove that subsequently led to the construction of the station.
Historical Association
When the Douglas to Port Erin Railway line was opened on the 1 August 1874, the
station consisted of a single track served by a ‘wooden sentry box’; built to offer
administrative facilities and some protection to the station master.
Even by 1875 this was found to be wholly inadequate, particularly during rain storms
when waiting passengers also attempted to take shelter in the box, and improved
facilities were requested.
The Superintendent of Line’s, F.H. Trevithick, solution was to bring the ‘box’ from
Santon, locate it adjacent to the existing ‘box’, join the two together with a roof: thus
creating a perfunctory shelter. A siding was also added to cater for Port Soderick
Cove ‘excursion coaches’.
In 1880 it was proposed to convert the existing siding to a full loop and to build a
station master’s house (at a price not exceeding £120).
The loop was apparently completed completed in 1881 but according to one source
and for some unrecorded reason, not officially commissioned until 1894.
In 1894 the Railway Company determined to improve the station with a budget of
£1800. Plans were drawn up (a Manx Museum reference is given by JIC Boyd - but
currently the whereabouts of the plans are ‘uncertain’) and tenders sought. At the
Page 1

General Purposes Committee meeting, of 19° December 1895, it was resolved to
accept the tender of James Cowle for the sum of £1054. It is assumed that the design
was also by James Cowle, it being known that he offered such as a service. By early
1896 the old station buildings had been demolished and a new purpose built, and
substantial, station house was well under construction. It was reported by the
Chairman, Goldie Taubman, at the March 1896 AGM that the new station was very
much required as the station master often had to walk some distance home at night
carrying all the takings; as it was unsatisfactory and unsafe leaving them at the station.
Furthermore, there were complaints from customers about the lack of refreshments
and shelter available whilst waiting for trains. Taubman stated that all of these failings
would be remedied by the new building. The new station building was completed
possibly by the autumn (Sept/Oct?) 1896 and included ticket office, licensed
refreshment hall and station masters accommodation.
In December 1896 a tender was accepted from Brook and Sons to build a ‘downside’
platform, that was flagged with Hipperhoime Yorkshire stone, at a cost of £1100, The
coping stones were paid for in March 1897, so it is assumed the work was completed
about that time.
At the AGM, held in March 1897, the Chairman’s Report included this excerpt:
“We have done something towards improving our stations during the year.
At Port Soderick, as you are no doubt aware, we have put up a good
substantial building at a cost of something like £1100. It is not a very
beautiful or ornamental! building, but it is admirably adapted to the use to
which we have put it.”
The station house continued to serve the railway for almost 100 years, except when it
was closed during the First World War and at other such times before dwindling
passengers and revenues forced the company to offer the house for private use. A
planning application was lodged in May 1979 by a prospective tenant, to convert the
station for adventure Holiday accommodation. Despite planning approval in principle
being granted, the plans did not progress.
In fact, by the time this application was made, owing to its financial plight, the Railway
Company had already succumbed to a takeover by the Government. At an extra-
ordinary A.G.M., held on 23 November 1977, the shareholders had accepted an offer
of purchase. The M.E.R. took control of the running of the Isle of Man Railway
Company on the 1% December 1977 and the Station became the property of the
M.E.R. Board on the 13" January 1978.
In possible preparation of its being offered for sale, the Station was transferred from
the ownership of the M.E.R. to the Government Property Trustees. When it was finally
sold in late 1984, for £15,000, it was described as near derelict; but was sold on the
proviso that the new owner had to retain the character of the building.

Some time during the mid 1980’s a mezzanine floor was installed, and other minor
alterations took place. Externally, there appears to be very few differences today to the
original structure, the tall chimney stack at the front of the building has been partially
removed, probably after the sale in 1984, it still being visible in the late sixties when the
building was painted grey with red woodwork; & shown on the 1979 Ellis Brown drawings.
Despite extensive searches, at the Museum, it has not been possible to find the Deed
recording the sale, of the land the station stands on, to the railway company. The
current owners abstract of title begins in 1981 when the GPT gained the title.
However, it is believed that the station was built on a part of the Ballavere Estate that,
certainly in the 1880’s, was owned by a William Moore.
Architectural Interest
This building is clearly interesting because of its association with other railway
buildings on the line. When opened it was described as ‘not very beautiful or
ornamental’ but this was probably to distinguish it from the greater effort put into
Douglas and the other ‘town’ stations. The building has much which is aesthetically
pleasing and which is of interest being planned as both a railway building and a
residence. It would have appeared very moder using vertical window divisions and
front facing gables as well as the castellation, which were very popular following
buildings such as Greeba Castle and the Nunnery.
The use of the casement windows was entirely compatible with other railway buildings
but less usual in Manx houses of the period where sliding sash windows would be the
norm. it was however during this period the casement design became increasingly
popular encouraged by the new designers like Baillie Scott and Armitage Rigby who
designed in the Arts and Crafts style.
The strange castellated ‘ears’ either side of the gables seem to be devised to
accommodate the chimney required for the third bedroom. The rhythm of the upper
storey, set up by the gables and window openings, is not rigidly followed by the
openings on the ground floor. The distinctive ivy covered lower storey, was already
established in 1907 (photo - Manx National Heritage) and may be to accommodate
and to disguise this fact. The ivy is carried on a metal frame and was recently pulled
forward to release trapped debris, which was causing damp in the building. The very
neat green boundary between public and residential domains is a very satisfying detail
and is judged to be a distinctive feature of the building.
The original plans are not available at present, nor has any research that may reveal
brief given to the designer. It would be interesting to know if the sized was determined
by a standard waiting room size, buy budget or indeed by the need to provide a full
three bed-roomed apartment. Census information regarding the occupancy (and need
for a third bedroom and ail castellations) will not be released until Jan 2002.

Conclusions
Although the building is described by its original owners as “not very beautiful or
ornamental” this is much too simplistic a view. Compared to the ‘Gothic’ styled station
building in Douglas it is plain but, when their settings are taken into account, both fit in
comfortably with their surroundings.
Additionally, its conversion to a private dwelling has been accomplished relatively
easily and its association, and proximity, to the steam railway has often been the
attraction to more recent owners.
Even the original proposed private use, that of an adventure holiday camp, shows how
existing buildings can be adapted to a variety of suitable and versatile uses. Port
Soderick Station is a good example of how ‘redundant’ buildings can be ‘recycled’,
satisfactorily converted and reused for other purposes.
The building by its proximity to the track, its continuity with the original track side
accommodation building of 1897 and the association with other railway buildings and
the present Port Soderick Halt, makes this a building of special Architectural interest.
The building, although not longer servicing the railway, is still an important part of the
Victorian built heritage of the Island and the Steam railway; and especially as its external
appearance remains very similar to when it was built over a hundred years ago.
The Port Soderick House is judged worthy of entry into Protected Buildings Register on
the following grounds:-
1) the buildings special architectural interest and aesthetic quality;
2) the buildings historical association with the development of the Isle of Man Steam
Railway system;
3) the buildings landmark qualities and the contribution which it makes to the rural
landscape of the Isle of Man.
