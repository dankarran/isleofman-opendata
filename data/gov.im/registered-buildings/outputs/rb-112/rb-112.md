FALCON CLIFF HOTEL
This was built in 1836 and was the Gothic design of John Robinson, the
local Architect. It was a residence for a short period of one of the
Governors of the Island. Tt was also the residence of Mr. Stanway
Jackson, who was manager of the Bank of Mona. Some time afterwards, a
Dr. Gough had a boarding school at the Cliff. After many changes, it
was bought by the Derby Castle Company, who owned property at Derby
Castle and Strathallan Crescent.
In 1907, 50,000 yards of land and the Falcon Cliff Hotel were put up
for auction by the Palace and Derby Castle Company. It was thought at
one time to make the Falcon Cliff into a Hydro but Dumbell’s Bank
failure put an end to that scheme.
The conditions of sale debarred forever the ground being a place of
amusement likely in all events to be in opposition to the Palace
Company, No factory was to be erected on the land and opposite to
Falcon Cliff Hotel was barred by providing that the hotel should be the
only licensed house on the estate. The 3 lots were sold to Mr. Griffon
for £11,300.
I presume the Palace Company bought back the Falcon Cliff, because they
sold it in 1919 to Ellan and Leo Kane. Okell and Sons bought the hotel
in 1948 and the Falcon Cliff was changed from a residential hotel to
its existing layout; with a large cabaret room and bars in the 1950s.
The present owners are Isle of Man Breweries.
