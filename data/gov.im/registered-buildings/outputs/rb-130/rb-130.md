St. Luke’s Church, Baldwin
St. Luke's stands on the site ofan ancient keeil, dedicated to St. Abban, and also itis
known as Abban’s Church of Killey Bane. Abban was an Irish Saint recorded in
the Calendar of Aengus, son of O'Comar of Lainster. There is very little known
about its carly history, and most of the information has been gathered from people
now long since passed on, or gleaned from various old history books.
Three churches have been known to have stood on this site. The first one being
built by a Holyman or hermit, who lived further down in the Baldwin valley
towards Injebreck, at a place called Ulican or Balla Leane (?) which he farmed.
These places were Nooded when the Baldwin reservoir was constructed. He burt
his tittle sod church in a hollow on the hillside, just below the ancient monument to
the old Tynwald Hill.a Cairn ring of stones, a few hundred yards above the church,
St. Luke’s was the anctent church of Tynwald, but this site was last use
around 1428. ~
The next church was slightly larger and was built by the inhabitants of both
Baldwin Valleys. as the site stood high on the hill overlooking both valleys. The
third church was the the stone built keeil. built for St. Abban, when he came to
administer to the people. The present church was built by Bishop Ward and con-
secrated on May 14th 1836, and named St. Luke’s. St. Luke’s was a daughter church
olf Kirk Braddan originally. but was transferred to the parish of Marown at the
boundary change-over of July 1978.
Bishop Ward and his daughter came on horseback to the Baldwin Valley and found
the existing church in a ruinous state, and decided to rebuild the present church on
this site. He was staying at the Castle Mona in Douglas. He Built four churches dur-
ing his time onthe Island, St. James’ at Dalby, St. Stephen’s at Sulby, St. Luke's, and
All Saints at Lonan (2). The architect was Walsh. who also designed and built the
Tower of Refuge.
‘
The farmers and crofters who had a horse and cart. carted ten loads of stone each,
giving two days each week lor this work, from the East Baldwin river, up throug—
Ballawyllan Farm. A quarry was also opened just behind the church for stone, and
the roof slates came from the slate quarrys on the side of Colden Mountain, just
above the Baldwin village. The families involved included the Cannells, Cowells,
Kellys. Quines and Killips. .
A few stones of the ancient keeil still remain and these are incorporated into the
cast wall. behind the high alter, just above the cast window, and under the bell
turret. There is no known foundation stone to the present church, but Bishop Ward
is thought to have laid a stone during the construction just below the bank level.
There is a stone, a red sandstone, possibly Peel, on a windowsill on the Southeast
side of the church with an incised linear cross, which is known focally as the
“Cursed Stone of Destiny”. [tis considered to be older than the 7th century.

The story goes thata certain farmer living nearby at Algale Farm, wished to build a
hew cow shed and removed some stones which included the incised cross stone
from the ruins of the then ancient keeil. After he had built the new cow shed, things
began to go all wrong for him on the farm. All his animals became sick and died.
his sheep, cows, pigs, horses and finally his wife fell i. He became so alraid that
she too would die, that he pulled down the cow shed with all haste. She survived
and in thankfulness for his wife's complete recovery to good health once more. set
about with gusto to help Bishop Ward to rebuild the new church in 1836.
Part of the church building was once used as a day school, under the terms of the
Education Act of 1870, this portion being the west end. The schoolmaster used to
ride a fine white horse, and he colleeted the money from the children’s parents once

“Three atlending, it cost you less, @ pence per week for each child.
Inside the church
The church is partly lit by ten brass oil lamps and heated by a large coke, peat and
wood burning stove, set in the middle of the church floor. The large pipe organ
came from Kentraugh Mansion House, but had been vandelised and lay broken
down for 46 years. In Millenium Year 1979 it was decided to repair the organ and
Messrs Wood Brothers of Hudderstield, organ builders, undertook the work,
The pulpit came from Kirk Braddan Church about 90 years ago. On the top leit
hand side, just below the brass candlestick, there is a groove cul into the pulpit top.
This was for the preacher to place his watch or sandtimer in to judge the 80 minute
sermon. The pulpit belore this one was one of the tree trunk style.
The font was piven in memory of Elenor Laird Warren by her father Major HL.

of the church and all the women and children sat on the other, separated by
the aisles.
