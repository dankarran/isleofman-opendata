INITIAL REPORT
THE OLD SAIL LOFT, PORT ST MARY,
ISLE OF MAN
From the earliest days of Registration, the area centering on The Harbour, Port St Mary,
has been identified as being of historic and architectural importance and as recognised in
a study of the Village of Port St Mary carried out by Melville Dunbar Associates in
December 1993.
“The surrounding buildings are generally of high quality. The most important
being the Old Net Factory... and the adjoining building to its North, previously
used as a sail loft, carpenters shop and smithy”.
The building was erected in 1858 to serve the needs of the fishing industry in the South of
the Island. It is evident from an examination of the exterior of the building that the 3-
storey sail loft building, was the first to be erected on the site and at some stage early in
the history of this building ihe adjoining dwelling was added onto the southern side of the
property.
Mr William Clucas, formerly a sail-maker, spent much of his life in Port St Mary and
recalled that his father had also been a sail-maker and rigger who had a business in the
loft located on the harbourside, from the early life of the building. His father employed 7
or 8 men making sails for schooners and other fishing boats.
Mr Clucas followed the same trade and was a skilled sail maker and rigger. Latterly he
was employed for more than 20 years by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. In the
early days, all of the working boats had sails and those of the fishing boats were made

from cotton canvas: schooner sails would be made from flax canvas. Large quantities of
fabric were required in the making up of the sails. The sail loft was where patterns for
sail-making were created and sails were laid out and fabricated.
A photograph in the Manx Museum archives shows Mr William Clucas in the sail room,
on the top floor of the large warehouse building, still operating as a sail-maker, in 1949.
With the recent demise of the owner Mr Alan Quillan, the property has lost the last in a
line of owner/occupiers who operated the trade of shipwright /sail-maker from this
building.
As stated, the upper floor ofthe building was used for sail maker’s loft: the middle floor
as a joinery/shipwright’ s workshop for purposes relating to the production of boats
operating out of Port St Mary and farther a field: the ground floor contains not one, but
two forges, for fabricating the iron elements of the craft including the long Keel plates. It
is of interest to note there is a small opening in the front gable elevation, underneath the
external staircase, whereby the continuous forging of the Keel plates was enabled as the
continuous length of plate extended from inside the workshop out onto the quayside.
Many items of interest were donated to the Manx Museum and National Trust sometime
ago and are held in the Nautical Museum in Castletown, however the building still
contains numerous items relating to its use and the property has changed very little during
its lifetime.
The sail loft and adjoining cottage together make a striking architectural statement on the
lower Shore Road, Port St Mary. The materials used in the construction of both sections
of the property are a mixture of local Manx slate stone, but other local stones are also
evident, in particular the large granite quoins (corner stones).
Much of the stonework is of high quality and laid in courses: slate lintels span all major

wae

openings and all but one window visible on the major elevations, are of original sliding
sash style.
The Old Sail Loft and the adjoining cottage are a unique remnant of the history of the
fishing industry of the Isle of Man.
As outlined in the catalogue accompanying the Great International Fishery Exhibition of
1883:
“Port St Mary with the adjacent ports of Castletown and Port Erin, is the next
most important port after Peel.... It contains one hundred and one boats,
representing a tonnage of 2,095 tons with a capital of £80,800 and employing 787
men and boys”,
The document goes on to explain “The insular Government... is constructing a new
breakwater at Port St Mary at a cost of £15,580.00 . ..There is no other portion of
Europe, and with the exception of Newfoundland, there is probably no other country in
the world, where so large a proportion of the population is dependent on fishing for their
livelihood”. It is further explained that in Great Britain the norm at that time was one
person out of every 75 employed on the fishing industry; however, in the Isle of Man, one
out of every 5 depended on fishing for his daily bread and one person out of every four
was directly or indirectly dependent on fishing for their livelihood. This indicates the
importance of the fishing industry in the historical and sociological development of the
Isle of Man, particularly in fishing ports of the Island.
It is accordingly judged that the Old Sail Loft has played a significant part in the
development of the village of Port St Mary and in the wider sense in the development of
the fishing industry in the Isle of Man. As such, the building should be recognised and
given the protection of Registered Building Status. It is accordingly recommended that
the building be advertised as being considered for entry into the Protected Buildings
Register.
