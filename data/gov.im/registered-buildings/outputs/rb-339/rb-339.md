Register Entry Summary – Leyton, Victoria Road 
 
Details 
Name: Leyton 
Address: Victoria Road, Douglas, IM2 6AQ 
Register Entry Number: 339 
Date of Registration: 28.2.2024 
 
History 
The site now occupied by Leyton was historically part of the Glencrutchery landholding. The owner 
of the land, Thomas Kneen, had the property built in 1896-97. When Lay bought the plot from Kneen 
(April 1897), the house was already erected and complete. There was a covenant on the land that 
only one dwelling was to be built on the plot. There is a date stone in the gable with William Lay’s 
initials on it.  
Thomas Kneen was a significant figure on the Isle of Man during the latter part of the 19th century 
and the early 20th century. The owner of Glencrutchery House, Farm and Lands, Kneen served as 
Captain of the parish of Onchan from 1895-1916, an MHK in 1890-91, and was a notable lawyer 
which culminated in being made Head of the Isle of Man’s Judiciary as Clerk of the Rolls from 1905-
1916. 
 
William Lay was a young advocate who qualified for the Manx Bar in 1891 at the age of 23. He set up 
his own practice in 1896 and later he took into partnership R G Johnson. In time he became High 
Bailiff of Peel and Ramsey which was a part time appointment and at the same time he continued 
practicing as an advocate. Then he became High Bailiff of Douglas and Castletown, a similar part 
time but busier role. Lay subsequently became the first full time High Bailiff for the whole Island. He 
had two sons who became advocates – one also subsequently became High Bailiff. 
 
Leyton is contemporary with the houses in Little Switzerland, as well as The Red House and Oakleigh. 
The house is a one-off compared to the other houses in Little Switzerland, having the first floor bay 
windows projecting over the ground floor. It has a mixture of sliding sash and casement windows 
throughout. At the side it has flat roofed dormers as used by Baillie Scott and an unusual roof scape. 
Records suggest that the house is not the work of either Baillie Scott or Armitage Rigby. 
 
Form and Materials 
Designed in an Arts and Crafts style, Leyton differs from all the other contemporary houses in the 
Little Switzerland /Victoria Road/ Glencrutchery Road area by virtue of its double frontage and its 
door set on the side. The porch on the side is a modern addition and the original front door was 
within the two storey side projection without a vestibule as was the case with Baillie Scott’s Red 
House originally. The front door faced the main road.  
On the gable between the original front door and the front corner of the house a carved sandstone 
plaque was inserted as the house was being erected. It bears the date 1896 and the initials W L 
(William Lay) intertwined. 

MATERIALS: Ballanard brickwork at ground floor level. Half-timbered first floor with render infill. 
Rosemary tiled roof. Painted timber framed windows. Painted timber fascias and barge boards. 
PLAN: Historic part of house has hallway on left hand side with stair to first floor and direct access to 
four rooms, two facing front and two facing rear. First floor landing gives access to WC, bathroom, 
and four bedrooms; two facing front and two facing rear. 
A modern flat roofed single storey extension at the rear contains a kitchen, sun room, rear lobby, 
shower room and WC. The porch at the front right corner of the house is not historic.  
EXTERIOR: Ground floor is finished in facing brickwork from Ballanard brickworks. First floor is black 
painted exposed timber with white painted render infill. Pitched roof is finished in rosemary tiles, 
dormer windows are flat roofed. Windows are a mixture of sliding sash and casement opening, all 
framed in white painted timber. Two first floor front facing oriel windows (one of which has been 
replaced in UPVC) sit above the ground floor bay windows. Fascias and barge boards are black 
painted timber.
