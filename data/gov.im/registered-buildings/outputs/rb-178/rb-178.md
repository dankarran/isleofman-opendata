THE PARISH CHURCH OF
ST THOMAS
DOUGLAS
HISTORICAL NOTES
The designer of St Thomas’ church was the renowned Victorian Architect
EWAN CHRISTIAN, who was President of the RIBA from 1884 - 86 and
for some considerable time, Architect to the Church Commissioners of
England. Related to the Christians of Milntown, Ewan Christian in 1887
achieved the status of Royal gold Medallist, . designing numerous
Ecclesiastical buildings the length and breadth of the country.
In a recent historical assessment of the former Isle of Man Lunatic Asylum
at Ballamona, ( now demolished), designed by Joseph Henry Christian who
was Ewan’s younger cousin, Mr Michael Eaton (Assessor for English
Heritage) commented:
ft is clear that Ewan Christian was highly regarded by his
contemporaries including Pearson, Teulon and Waterhouse, and was
given an extensive, though delayed, obituary by the RIBA
Ewan Christian rose through the ranks of the architectural profession to
become very highly regarded in his time and undoubtedly was one of the
most successful and widely recognised Victorian Architects to which the Isle
of Man can lay claim.
Although the foundation stone for the Parish Church of St Thomas was laid in
the 9" July, 1846, and the Church was licensed for worship on the 1ts August,
1849, by Lord Auckland the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, disputes arose as
to the patronage of the Church and it was not until the 29" June, 1872 that
this was finally resolved and the Church was consecrated and re-opened for
Divine Service.

Protected Buildings Register St Thomas Church
The Victorian Gothic style of the Church owes much to the Early English
period of architecture and has three tall Lancet windows in both East and
West fronts, surmounted by a Rose window. Most of the other window
openings are of the same form and are grouped in pairs between the buttresses
of the long North and South walls. The Clerestory windows are of a trefoil
design and allow natural daylight to penetrate the structure of the lofty timber
roof, which is characteristic of early Gothic style. The original design was to
have incorporated a tower surmounted by a spire, however this idea was
abandoned due to difficulty in securing a good foundation for the structure.
Much of the Church’s interior is of special quality with many items having
been donated by parishioners in memory of loved ones, or by subscription.
It is known that several of the stained glass windows in the Church are the
work of Messrs Heaton, Butler & Bayne who were a firm of considerable
repute and who were involved in a phase which produced a more inventive
recreation of the medieval canon than had been usual, much of their best
work, marked by simple linear designs and strong colours, being produced
during the 1860’s.The firm’s work became distinctive by its use of specially
commissioned coloured glass and other examples of their work can be found
in:
a) Te Deum window, All Saints, Clapham Park, London;
b) East Window - Crucifixion, Prickwillow, Cambridgeshire, and
oy) Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (1866) formerly in St
Andrew, Bridport, Dorset but now in Ely Cathedral: Stained Glass
museum,
The Chancel floor originally had a tiled finish, but was re-floored with
Italian Marble as were the Aisles and a step of Belgian black marble placed in
the Sanctuary. The chancel floor shows the figure of St Thomas holding a
model of the Church.

The Nicholson Murals
Following the re-opening of St Thomas’ in 1872, several improvements were
made to the fabric and decoration of the Church.
In 1882 Canon Emest Savage MA, FSA, was appointed Vicar and being a
keen Church historian he became the driving force behind the move to have
St Thomas’ decorated internally which ultimately led to the result which we
see today.
At an Easter vestry meeting held in 1896, it was proposed by Deemster Gill
that an estimate and plans be obtained for cleaning and beautifying the walls
of the Chancel. A further meeting was held on the 6" May, 1896 when it was
agreed that Messrs Nicholson Brothers be asked to undertake this work. Plans
were approved by the Lord Bishop for a Chancel Screen and the wall
decoration.
The large and impressive scheme of wall paintings in St Thomas’ church was
carried out by the renowned focal artist John Millar Nicholson R A. By
April 1897, the work on painting the Chancel was almost completed, but the
funds began to run out and it was not until 1910 that the scheme was finally
completed. The completion of the murals was marked by a special Service
held on the 10" April, 1910. The original concept was to include painting the
walls both above and beneath the galleries, but this was not to be.
The following description of the murals is taken from ‘ The Parish Church of
St Thomas, Douglas - A Short History’ published in 1998 and which is based
on the 1970 - 71 Presidential Address given to the Isle of Man Natural
History and Antiquarian Society by Mrs. A. G. Flanagan.

‘Description of the Murals
In Mediaeval times, when decoration was at its best, the colour was
always introduced on the background, and the scenes, figures or
emblems to be shown were drawn in outline. In St Thomas’ Church
the reddish brown background that is used on the walls is the same
tone that is used in the celebrated ancient wall decorations of
Friskney Church, Lincolnshire. The blue background is the same
Shade found in similar old work in Canterbury Cathedral. Our
forefathers would not just decorate the walls of Churches for the sake
of it; wall decoration was meant to be instructive. The same doctrine
was applied to the decoration of St Thomas’ when Canon Savage
asked John Nicholson to give expression to his thoughts.
In the uppermost compartment at the west end in the walls of the
nave, the ground is painted sky-blue and the white ornament is the
heraldic representation of clouds; below that, the base of the
clerestory windows and the apex of the nave arches, is an
“Arcading”’, which runs the whole length of the Church on both sides
and across the west end. The thought running through the main
scheme - on the west wall, the foliage of the Tree of Life - Cherubim
placed at the east end of the Garden of Eden, with flaming sword to
keep the way of the Tree of Life - seen on either side of the west
gallery. In the spandrels of the arches in the Nave nearest to the west
end, are representations of the Worship in the Jewish Tabernacle and
Temple -
The Altar of Incense
The Ark of the Covenant
The Golden Candlestick
The Table of Shewbread

In the next pair of Arches are the four representations of the
Evangelists -
Man(Angel) - St Matthew
Lion - St Mark
Ox - St Luke
Eagle - St John
In the next pair of Arches are the Christian Emblems -
The Lamb - Pelican - Phoenix and Dove
In the next pair of Arches are the emblems of Christian Life and
Character -
The Vine Branch, the Lily and the Olive and Palm Tree
The Chancel
On the highest part of the walls and over the east window are flying
angels supporting a scroll on which the Hymn appears :-
‘Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts - (North Wall)
Heaven and earth are full of Thy Glory - (East Wall)
Glory be to Thee O Lord Most High’ - (South Wall)
In the lower compartments are Angels on the other side of the Organ;
Archangels on either side of the Reredos, and ‘All the company of
Heaven’ in the two other compartments on the south wall.
The next compartment on the northern wall shows Michael fighting
with the many headed dragon. In the opposite compartment of the
south wall is the figure of the Archangel Gabriel coming with the
message of the Incarnation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The actual
scene here shown is taken from the account that is given in a very
ancient Christian narrative of our Lord’s birth, called “The
Protevangelion”’.
The double compartment on the south wall shows the “great multitude
which no man could number”, described in Revelation VII, “clothed
in white robes” the emblem of Purity, and “with palms in their
hands", the emblem of Victory.

St Thomas Church

Protected Buildings Register St Thomas Church
The walls between the texts and the oak panelling are decorated with
wheat and grapes and diaper work of Vine leaves, emblematic of the
Holy Communion.
On the east wall running up between the three lights of the window, is
the “Tree of Life”, on either side of the “River of Life’ which bear
twelve manner offruits, and leaves of the tree were for the healing of
the Nations. (Rev XXII, 2).’
In recent years interest in the Murals has grown and their true merit is only
just beginning to be recognised.
In 1997, with guidance from The Council for the care of Churches, it was
decided to seek specialist advice on the condition and possible repair and
restoration of the Murals, which by that time had deteriorated in places, as a
result of rainwater penetration in certain sections of the fabric of the building.
Tobit Curteis Associates - Wall Painting Conservators, (Principal Tobit
Curteis BA (Hons) Dip Conservation (Courtauld Institute) ), were asked to
survey the murals and to make proposals for their conservation. In due course
a very detailed Report was submitted to the Parochial Church Council who
then embarked upon a massive fund-raising exercise and at the time of
writing, a comprehensive programme of repair and restoration of the Murals
is underway and is approximately half completed.
On page 2 of his report Mr. Curteis says:
‘Although the original decoration of the interior was somewhat plain,
between 1896 and 1910 the walls of the nave and chancel were
elaborately painted by the local artist John Miller Nicholson(d. 1913).
While the style of the decoration is relatively simple in some areas,
the impact of the overall scheme is extremely dramatic. The very size
of the scheme, over 520 square metres of decorative painting, as well
as its unique position on the Isle of Man, makes this an unusual and
significant scheme of paintings’.

The Parish Church of St Thomas, Douglas is considered to be of special
architectural and historic interest and is accordingly entered into the
Protected Buildings Register on the following grounds:
1. The building is a unique example of decorative art and craftsmanship
and this is particularly represented in the highly decorative Wall
Paintings which were carried out by the renowned local artist JOHN
MILLAR NICHOLSON, RA (d. 1913), between the years 1896 and
1910.
2. The building was designed by the eminent Victorian Architect EWAN
CHRISTIAN, President of the RIBA from 1884 to 1886 and for much
of his career, Architect to the Church Commissioners of England.
3. The building makes a very important contribution to the streetscape
of the Town of Douglas, occupying a very prominent corner site in the
heart of the Island’s Capital.
