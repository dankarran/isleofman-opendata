Register entry description 
 
History 
 
The Mitre was originally known as Ballachrink, or Ballachrink House, the name usually taken to 
mean ‘hill farm.’ The Manorial Roll of 1511/15151 identifies it (spelt without the ‘h’) as a 
quarterland in the treen of Dromerewaigh in the Parish of Michael. 
 
It is believed to have become a coaching inn in 1786, but it also continued as a farm, 
sometimes divided into several tenancies. It appears from the Manx Wills records to have been 
occupied during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by a family by the name of Cannell.  
Notably, it was sold by the Trustees of Lady Buchan’s estate in 1890. As her father, Colonel 
Wilks (1759 – 1831), had been born in Kirk Michael Rectory, where his father Rev James Wilks 
(1719 – 1777)3 was appointed Vicar in 1752. it may well have come into her substantial 
property portfolio via her father’s will. The Rev Wilks had been closely associated with Bishop 
Wilson and, therefore, the ecclesiastical courthouse adjacent to the Mitre.

Entry Summary PRINTED 07.04.2021 
Details 
The Mitre is a traditionally-styled Manx public house believed to date back to 1786 previously a 
Quaterland Farmhouse. 
 
MATERIALS: 
Coursed rubble stone walls under render finish with slate roof. 
PLAN: 
Linear plan form arrangement.  
EXTERIOR: 
The Mitre is comprised of of two two-storey houses (one three-bay and one four-bay), the join 
marked by a raised gable closing, and flanked by smaller extensions at either end .The three-
bay house is the tallest and largest, and is almost certainly the original Ballachrink House. 
There is a small lead-roofed dormer with a two-light window set slightly off-centre, and 
traditional raised closings to the gables are topped by chimney stacks. The stone walls are 
rendered smooth and painted. The windows are evenly placed, three per floor, apart from the 
extra length of wall at what would have been the larger chiollagh end to the south. All 
windows are two-on-two sashes, frames painted white. The south gable sits forward of the 
adjoining extension, sufficient to permit a similar but slightly smaller window in the gable on 
each floor. The felted flat-roofed fully-enclosed porch is placed over what would have been the 
northern-most ground floor window. The fascia is painted to match the render and gives a 
double-moulding effect. There is a door-shaped recess on the south elevation of the porch, 
indicating the former presence of an entrance door or large window. The porch acts as a 
vestibule, with outer and inner doors. 
The two-storey extension to the south is set back from the main frontage and has the roof 
ridge set behind the main one. Similarly treated as the main elements, this extension has a 
single two-on-two first floor window with a shallow arched head, and two openings on the 
ground floor of the main elevation, one a window and the other a sealed former door (both 
with flat lintols). Once again, there is a raised closing to the gable and a chimney stack. Added 
to the south and slightly set back is an open-fronted slate-roofed smoking shelter facing onto 
the side passageway. It has a small two-on-two window in the front-facing elevation and is 
rendered and painted to match the rest of the building. 
The four-bay house is to the north, similarly finished to the three-bay house, with a slightly 
lower roof, no dormer, and a smaller felted flat-roofed fully-enclosed porch over the third 
ground floor window position from the north gable. The fourth pair of windows (ground floor, 
first floor) are butted against the south gable. There is a further raised gable with stack on the 
north gable.  
A single storey extension butts the north gable. It has a slated pitched roof, and single 
windows facing the road (west) and the rear garden (east). There is a small smokers’ shelter 
behind the snooker room. 
Either side of the two porches are the raised black letters ‘OKELL’S’ to the left and ‘THE 
MITRE’ to the right. Manx flags on short struts are set into small metal shoes at mid-window 
height beside each window along the main two-house elements of the frontage. 
INTERIOR: 
The ground floor interior of these two two-storey elements of the Mitre is a bar/dining area, 
entered via the porch. The interior of the main ‘house’ is a single space, with another door-less 
dining area in the extension. Immediately on the left of the vestibule, there is a door into the 
adjoining public bar. The bar counter faces the door, and there is a short privacy/draught 
screen to the right. Woodwork to the interior is painted a similar soft Scandinavian green to 
the exterior. The floor is slate flagged (or faux slate tiled) up to the far side of what would 
have been the central partition at the staircase, where a door opening leads to the toilets and 
kitchen. This division is further marked by the carpeted floor and a prominent timber beam 
with Gothic letting in gold – ‘Mitre Hotel 1789’ supported by short piers. The extension is 
entered to the left of the former chiollagh, which is rendered over.
