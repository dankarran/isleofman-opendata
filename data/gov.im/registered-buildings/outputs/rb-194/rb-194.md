The Old Chapel,
former Methodist Chapel, Christian Street, Peel
Architectural and Historic interest
The Old Chapel, Christian Street, Peel first opened in 1878 and was then known as the
“Primitive Chapel”. However, in order to unravel its full history one must regress a
further four years to the quarterly meeting of the circuit which gave the Chapel
permission “to raise money by all prudent means for the erection of a new chapel”
necessitated by sheer overcrowding of the congregation. This initiative is set against the
background of religious fervour which led to the great waive of Church and Chapel
building found throughout the Island during the reign of Queen Victoria.
The fund raising was led by the Reverend George Smith and some dedicated workers,
and not surprisingly, it proved to be a difficult feat in the days when the people “were
almost entirely fisher folk, earning a precarious living.” When one considers that the
Minister’s salary was £36 per annum and the Chapel Keeper’s only 25/-, more often than
not, there would be a balance of two pence reached in the annual financial statement, if it
was not, in fact, in the red. However, fund raising efforts were successful with the first
third of the £3,000 which it cost to erect the Chapel, coming from small donations given
by people “who had not a great deal of this world’s goods.” The building opened in
1878, lit by candlelight and with seating for 700 people. The final debts for the building
however, were not paid off until shortly before the Jubilee in 1928 and the financial
struggle to maintain the building continued with collections at the Jubilee services,
community hymn singing and other celebrations, raising money for re-roofing the hall
and improving the manse.
The church was a place of family worship, with a friendly, welcoming atmosphere
where social events were said to be “jolly and organised by a hard working band of
”
church goers.” A majority of such organisers were thought to be women. The most well

known events which the church held were ithe “Easter Effort” which stretched back for
over 80 years, as well as the Eisteddfod each winter.
In recent years the fate of the 1870’s Church has gone the same as many other Manx
Church buildings. With congregational numbers falling, the viability of sustaining so
many places of worship in one area, became untenable and on September Ist 1960 the
Peel Methodist Churches amalgamated as one. The Christian Street Methodist Church
closed its doors in order for the Atholl Street Methodist Church to be re-decorated and to
take over as the principal Methodist Church in Peel. Since then, the building has been
used as a second hand furniture store which has now closed for business.
ARCHITECTURE
The exterior of the building remains substantially the same as when it was originally
built, save for the removal in recent years, of the front boundary walls, pillars and
railings.
The building is simple in its form adopting the oblong, galleried arrangement, typical of
Methodist Chapels of this period, with access to the upper galleried level being by way of
twin staircases located on either side of the main entrance from Christian Street.
Walls are constructed from local Peel sandstone, of which the front, principal, elevation
is rendered in the Neo-Classical style. A similar approach is seen in other large Methodist
Churches elsewhere on the Island, as found in Ramsey and Glen Road, Laxey.
The treatment of the main elevation is well ordered and distinguished in appearance.
Entrance is b y way of a pedimented portico, with corbelled bracket details to the cornice
and mouldings to the pediment. A simple frieze is supported on iwo sets of modified
Doric columns, one square and one round in section. Above the Portico is set a large, true
arch-headed window, which would have almost stretched the full height of the internal
upper level. Other windows on this elevation echo the overall shape of this central
window, but are smaller in size and adopt a different approach to the glazing pattern.
These windows. together with those on the flank walls would have given a very light and
airy quality to the interior ofthe building.

Two storey, rusticated pilasters give scale to the composition and carry a split comice,
again with corbelled bracket details. Springing from the comice a simple, inset arch
echoes the shape of the central window and above this we find the gable peak expressed
above the main roof line and again terminating in a projecting comice.
One of the most important aspects of this architecturally striking building is found in the
rich contribution which it makes to the townscape of Peel and the character of the
Conservation Area as a whole. The roof form and upper level of the principal elevation
can be clearly seen rising above the more humble vernacular buildings, when viewed
from various points around the city of Peel, particularly from the breakwater and from the
ramparts of the ancient Castle on St Patrick’s Isle.
The Old Chapel, former Methodist Chapel, Christian Street, Peel is judged worthy
of entry into the Protected Buildings Register by virtue of its special architectural
and historic interest on the following grounds:-
1. Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality: the approach to architectural
design, form and scale employed in this building; in particular in relation to the
appearance of the principal elevation fronting onto Christian Street, is of
sufficient quality to merit protection and recognition;
2. Historic Interest: the building has played an important part in the development
of Methodism in the Isle of Man, with particular reference to the locality of Peel.
3. Landmark qualities; the building makes a striking contribution to the
Conservation Area which focuses upon the historic townscape of Peel. The
property can be clearly seen from various vantage points, both within and outwith
the Conservation Area.
