‘altered to create an open plan
THE BRIDGE INN
Survey Report
Originally a robust solid |
Victorian building of 2
storeys plus cellars and attic,
it has had its Ground Floor
space. Thé First Floor has
also undergone substantial re-
arrangement and now houses
the Manager’s Flat.
' The. Bridge Inn — river front
Basically a “U” shaped
plan, with two unequal but
adjoining legs, at some
time, quite long ago, I feel,
it has had the corner
between the two unequal
projections filled-in but
only at ground floor level,
with a triangular structure
with a lean-to roof. This
now forms part of the open-
: . plan, ground floor public
Right-hand, Bowring Road, side elevation bar.
It is situated on a pronounced
‘hump’ in the ground, essentially
part of an artificial embankment
enclosing the river.!
Thus the cellar is only half buried
with enclosing _retaining-wall
surrounds to the full-length sash
windows. The ground slopes away
at the west (Lh.) side and the back
down to the level of Bridge Lane.
It is a three bay building with the
main front to the river although the
main entrance is on the r.h. side
facing Bowring Road.
Rear view
' Clifford Teare, whose family have lived and worked in this vicinity for very many years, says that tradition has it that the pub
was built first and then the ground heaped-up around it. It could well be true as part of building of the then new bridge.

It has 12 light sliding sash windows on all ground floor and main upper floor
elevations. Only the first floor windows on the projecting longer leg of the “U” have
their glazing bars omitted. The attics have paired, tall and very narrow windows on
each gable piercing the chimney breasts. These are also sliding sashes ,divided into 4
to match the rhythm of the lower main windows. All the divided windows have, stone
like, projecting cills.
There is a simple, plain cornice across the top of the
front elevation which seems to have deminished
somewhat from that indicated on earlier photographs
with a plain parapet above which now carries the
Hotel’s name, as it did in some early photos though
others show it as a banner below the 1%. floor
windows.
The roofs are of Welsh slate with blue clay ridges
and small cement verge-cappings.
The whole building appears gray in the earliest
photographs, looking almost like exposed stonework
with wide cement reveals. Now and for some time
past it has been cement rendered and painted, ie :
currently cream, with narrow, white painted cement Left side and river front view
bands around the windows and with chimney cappings, verges, cornice and cill picked
out in red/brown. The roadside elevation sports a wooden name board and two other
board signs, allin matching red/brown °-. -*
The front ‘public’ entrance consists of a pair of narrow, half glazed doors with
matching side-lights and 3 light fanlight above. There is another door on the Lh.
elevation giving access via a half-landing at a mezzanine level twixt cellar and ground
floor. There is also a barrel-drop on the same elevation directly into the beer cellar.
The basic internal
plan of the building
is a double “H” thus:
though on the
ground floor most of
these walls have
been taken out and
replaced by beams.
The service area of
Inthe cellars the Bar sits in the
central intersection facing both to the Public Bar on the right and
the Saloon Bar on the left.

Outside the adjoining plot to the west, once seemingly occupied by buildings and
garden, has been totally cleared and is now all given over to car-parking. There
remains only a very small fenced-off enclosure at the north-west apex of the property
forming a small yard for the storage of empty crates and beer kegs.
Assessment.
The Bridge Inn makes a very important contribution to the bridge-head both because
of its design and its robust setting on a slight (artificial) rise and forms a nucleus
which would be sadly missed were it to be demolished. In a nutshell, it’s importance
is one of GROUP VALUE and may possibly be worthy of Registration on this factor
alone.

A careful look at the 1869 Ordnance Survey map tells us
quite a lot. At that date the building was an “L” shape, so
we can deduce that the r.h. rear projection was earlier than
the longer, Lh. one and may perhaps be part ofthe
original. It also appears on Photos 3 & 7
The later r.h. extension appears in Photos 3 & 6
The buildings and walled-in gardens/yards shown on the
map alongside the left flank of the Inn must have been
low structures and though they can be faintly discerned in
Photo 4 and some trees in Photo 6, they have now
completely gone.
Note also on the map the walled-in area on the river front
with a gate leading to the side of the low building.
A more madern photograph of the Bridge inn’ It is also interesting to note the gated entrance to what was
. to become “Port Natal” and that only the first dwelling,
with its prominent side entrance portico, had then been
built.
Constance Radcliffe tells us that an Inn was operating in the old Ballachrink farmhouse on the site of the house now
known as “Eskdale” immediately above the present North Ramsey Post Office; the house occupier by Marjery Freer
in 1711. The Licensee of this Inn between the late 1830’s and the early 1840’s was Margaret Christian nee
Quayle, who was the heiress of the “Eskdale” property, and whose husband, William Christian Rheynn
Traie, had inherited lands along the present Windsor Mount and in the Shipyard area. On her retirement in
the 1850’s, the new Bridge Inn was built opposite” by Daniel Callow, a Ramsey mason & builder who
installed his daughter Eleanor Christian as the first Landlady. She seems to have been succeeded by
Margaret Sutherland nee Joughin.
Other early occupiers, taken from the Census Returns, include:
1851 Census: Margaret Christian Innkeeper?
William “ son — farms 20 acres
Isabelle “ daughter 24 yrs
Thomas “ son — joiner 2lyrs
