Reasons for Registration 
Derby House (The Old Post Office), Castletown, is included in the Protected Buildings Register for the 
following reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST:  
• 
The building is a surviving example of a mid-19th century property with commercial and 
residential uses that retains much of its historic form, together with elements of its historic fabric 
and detailing.  
HISTORIC INTEREST:  
• 
Dating from the mid-19th century, the building is known to have been used as a Draper’s 
from at least the 1880s, and subsequently as a restaurant and a Post Office. The property’s mixed 
commercial uses since the mid-19th century help illustrate elements of the nation’s economic and 
social history.
