description Intersection of Victoria Street and Loch Promenude
The Jubilee Clock is a typical "Victorian" monument conprising a
single stone column on a conically elevated tiered base. supporting
a cubical housing for a four-faced clock which is "crowned" by a
metalic decoex.tion. The clock faces sre relatively small for public
use and the scale of the monument is appropriate to this limitation,
Two traffie directional signs"grace" the protective lower projection
of the base to the 2cwise vulnerable column.
recommendation
The Jubilee Clock hes ohtvious histoviesl significance and clearly
qualifies for protection.
By its nature it is mplisely to b subjected
to any alteration but should peorhups be subjected to sting and
parvicula: consideration with respect to traffic signa and/or
further illumination. It is not imeurascivible thst at some point in
the future the monunent could be relocated intact since there does
not appear to be any over-riding significance to its prowent location
other than to punctuate Victoria Street.

Jubilee Clock
Victoria Street, Douglas
Situated as it is at the end of Victoria Street at it junction with Loch Promenade, the Jubilee
Clock is a landmark in Douglas and is eminently visible to all visitors leaving the Sea
Terminal and decanting towards the hotels on the promenade.
The word Jubilee refers to Queen Victoria’s golden jubilee and as such the clock dates from
1887. This is well evidenced by the plaque which forms part of the plinth of the clock.
The designer as such is not known but the clock was manufactured by W MacFarlane & Co
of Glasgow. Whilst a number of the decorative mouldings/reliefs which form the ornament
of the clock appear standard, there is only one other like it at Rotherham, Yorkshire.
Referred to as the Hastings Clock some references mistakenly locate this sister clock at
Hastings, Sussex. -
The Clock is built of cast iron with a paint finish and white enamel dials. It has not been
possible to identify the original colour scheme although a redecoration contract in 1892
required “three coats of paint and gilding in a manner similar to when it was first erected”,
The original design included separate drinking fountains for people, horses and dogs. Two
small troughs remain, but only the holes for the fixing bolts for the larger, free standing
horse trough are visible. An access panel to the interior may or may not be original. In
addition there is a memorial plaque describing works when the clock was refurbished as part
of the Douglas Centenary in 1996. It is not known if this replaces an earlier plaque.
The clock has four faces and sits over an octagonal column and plinth. It is surmounted by
an open cupola with finial carrying a bell. It is a fine example of high Victorian decorative
ironwork which is impressive without being over grand. It has to be said, however, that at
present the clock is not well set off and the provision of modern street furniture, in
particular lamp posts and traffic signs, are such that they diminish its presence.
The interior of the clock has not been inspected and it is understood that much of if not all
of the original mechanisms have now been removed. These internal alterations to not
detract from the importance of the clock although it would be nice to think that they could
be located and, together with the missing horse trough, be reinstated or exhibited elsewhere.
In this respect, it is pertinent to note the original illumination of the clock faces was by
gaslight.

The clock was donated by George W Dumbell a well known Douglas merchant and banker.
(Hence Dumbell’s clock as it is sometimes known). His name lives on in Manx history, for
example Dumbell’s Terrace in Laxey and he is synonymous with the Laxey Wheel and
Dumbell’s Bank.
The clock is currently in reasonable condition although some rusting is visible. It was
refurbished by Douglas Corporation in 1996.
The clock is a memorial to Queen Victoria and all that her name evokes. It has landmark
status and strong links with historic people and events that are an integral part of Manx
history. It deserves to be preserved.
