Register entry description 
History 
Kentraugh Estate was originally the family seat of one of the Island’s oldest and most 
respected families, the Qualtroughs. Records, according to Mona Douglas’s book, They Lived in 
Ellan Vannin, suggest that they were given the rights to the land from one of the first Norse 
Manx Kings. The name Kentraugh derives from the Manx Gaelic, Kione-traie, meaning End of 
the Shore (P, Tutt). 
In 1430 a ‘Mac Qualtroughe (sic) was apparently consulted with regards to the creation of the 
Manx Statute Laws as given in Mills Statutes. Additionally, the Manorial Rolls of 1511 - 1515 
states that a Robert McWhaltragh (sic) and his two sons were in residence and liable to a 
Manorial charge of 65 shillings for both the land and ‘2 tenements’. 
Records show that the estate, located on a gentle rise, comprised of twelve farms, three mills 
(not the Flour or Bone Mills within the estate) and the main estate house, in conjunction with 
various other smaller dwellings. Of the three mills recorded at the time, one was known to be

in operation owned by Robert Qualtrough (McWaltragh) in 1506. (A Quote of Qualtrough. M. 
Qualtrough & E. Feist see also 1511 manorial Rolls). 
The estate house, according to Slater’s Directory of 1846, was reportedly constructed from 
‘freestone’ taken from the quarries of Mostyn, Denbighshire, as opposed to the predominant 
limestone of the immediate area. The house, he notes, “is unequalled in the island”. (Cringle, 
Manx Millennium) and was the work of two of the island’s most noted architects/builders, John 
Welch and Thomas Brine. Predominant in the early 1800’s, these individuals were responsible 
for many of the island’s most celebrated buildings. 
The Kentraugh Estate was acquired by Edward Gawne (also known at the time as Ned the 
Brewer) in the early 1820’s, having apparently foreclosed on a loan made to Thomas 
Qualtrough at that time. (M. Douglas.‘They Lived in Ellan Vannin’). During the period, 1813 – 
1820’s, according to Crumplin & Rawcliffe, (‘A Time of Manx Cheer’) there was a notable lack 
of money circulating the island as a result of the Napoleonic wars. This inevitably led to the 
brewing business (which Edward Gawne was directly involved in) entering into a state of 
depression with many being sold on or closed. It is stated that Thomas Qualtrough borrowed 
money from Edward Gawne and, upon not being able to repay the loan, Edward Gawne used 
the Law as it then stood (in the Isle of Man), of being able to claim the whole Qualtrough 
estate despite the value of the estate exceeding that of the original loan.  
The corn mill which had always historically been a part of the estate (as recorded in the 1511 
Manorial Rolls), remained in the hands of the Qualtrough family until 1904. 
Both the Qualtroughs and the Gawnes were prolific figures in Manx affairs as a succession of 
these families served as MHK’s. Edward Gawne’s son, Edward Moore Gawne, was later noted 
in the 1861 census as ‘Landed proprietor’ with 277 acres in addition to being Captain of the 
Parish and a Magistrate. He was later to become an MHK and Speaker of the House of Keys. 
His social standing was further advanced through marriage to the cousin of the Duke of Athol 
(A.W. Moore Manx Worthies). 
Details 
Details 
Estate House of the Early 19th Century, possibly containing elements of an earlier house with 
later additions and curtilage structures including Lodge houses, Stable yard and stables, 
greenhouses, ice house, bone and saw mill, flour mill and estate walling. 
Main House 
MATERIALS: 
Mostyn Freestone, render, under slate roofs, timber windows. 
PLAN: 
Five bay house of two stories plus attic with single storey saloon, library, conservatory and 
service wing to the north.  
EXTERIOR: 
Principle elevation: 
Five bay house under pitched roof with deep bracketed eaves with stacks at each end. First 
floor windows pedimented with timber tripartite sash windows. Ground floor colonnaded 
portico with fluted Doric columns, freeze with waterleaf and dart detailing, balustrade above 
cornice wrapping around front elevation terminated in squared pilasters. Central doorway with 
depressed arch fanlight and case with clustered columns. Banded stucco render with four

INTERIOR: 
Not yet inspected 
Greenhouses/Estate Offices/stable yard: 
To the north of the house is a series of green houses. Adjacent to the service wing is a 
complex of stables, coach house, pigeon tower and other outbuildings set within a cobbled 
yard with arched entrance opening in the estate wall.    
Lodge Houses: 
The lodge houses located on Shore Road are largely the same in size and overall design. 
Bone & Saw Mill 
This structure is located on the bridge/foreshore on the rise above Gansey beach. From the 
road the building appears to be a single storey structure with its principle door framed by two 
small stone columns, exiting onto the main road. Closer inspection of the building from the 
beach reveals a far more substantial building than the initial impression one gets when viewing 
it from road level. Originally two structures, only one now remains which itself has been 
encroached upon by the rising bank of stone and shingle washed up from the sea which also 
serves to obscure the original slip-way/jetty shown on the 1869 Ordnance Survey Map.. 
From the road it is also possible to still view the existing Leat/Mill Race leading from the estate 
interior which runs adjacent to the river on an elevated embankment constructed from a spur 
on from the main river. 
The Ice House 
Positioned on the headland above the Saw & Bone Mill, Kentraugh’s ice house remains one of 
only two such ice houses on the island, so making them exceptionally rare. The remains of a 
second are located at Bishopscourt. The earthen mound is located on the left as one 
approaches Gansey promenade from the east. Closer inspection reveals that what at first 
appears to be a large boulder embedded in the soil is in fact the main entrance into the ice 
house. Elsewhere, soil has eroded to reveal sections of timber planking which have been used 
to insulate the roof before covering with rubble then rendering over it before finally covering 
with soil. The roof itself is domed with just a short entrance way visible.  
Subsidiary Features:  
The ha-ha splits the lawn and park that provide the setting for the estate house’s principal 
elevation, and is a rare example of estate garden design. 
The surviving estate boundary walls provide a context and in many locations a clear definition 
to the estate, and are included within the Registration Entry Summary.
