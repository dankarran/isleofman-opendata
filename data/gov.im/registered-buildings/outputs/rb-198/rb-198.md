THE FORMER ISLE OF MAN TIMES OFFICE
9, ATHOL STREET, DOUGLAS
The Isle of Man Times newspaper came into existence on the 4th May
1861, when Brown’s Advertising Circular was merged with the first
number of the Isle of Man Times. The founder was James Brown and
his son, John Archibald Brown, was the first reporter. From the
second publication, James Brown began an attack on the methods of
government of the self-elected Legislature. These attacks resulted in
Brown being imprisoned in Castle Rushen in March 1864. He was
later released and awarded £500 damages against the ‘Keys’ for false
imprisonment. He continued to fight for the end of self-elected ‘Keys’,
which was achieved in 1866.
In the edition dated 11‘ May 1872, number 9 Athol Street replaced
the newspaper’s previous address of Wellington Street. James Brown
died in 1881, but his son, John Archibald, had become responsible for
the editorship and management of the paper in February 1877.
The Isle of Man Times of 6 May 1882 writes: In May 1870, our
offices were removed to the St. George’s Hall, Athol Street; and on the
purchase of the building by Mr James Kissack, in 1872, we became
owners of our present premises, which were rebuilt in 1879 and 1880.
By Excavating, a splendid machine-room was made downstairs, whilst
in the upstair rooms have been established bookbinding, lithography,
stereotyping, and other industries connected with a well-appointed
and extensive printing and publishing business.’
The business was incorporated as a limited company, called Brown
and Sons Limited, in 1896. John Archibald Brown died in 1925, and
the Directors appointed his son, George John Archibald Brown, as
Editor of the newspaper and Managing Director of the printing
business.
It is not clear how complete the rebuilding was but, with the exception
of the ground floor, the elevation created was that which exists today.
It was vastly different to the previous building shown in an engraving
and photograph dated 1867.
As the works included excavation to form the machine-room in the
basement, it can reasonably be assumed that the works of rebuilding
were extensive. In 1894, permission was granted to extend the four-
storey Athol Street premises backwards, to emerge on Nelson Street.
An impressive facade, over three floors and some twenty-two feet in
width, abutted the premises of Dumbell’s Bank (now NatWest Bank).

In The Times’ dated 2.4 May 1936, a photograph of the Athol Street
elevation shows the ground floor premises as we see them today. It
has not been possible to ascertain with any accuracy the date of the
ground floor alterations. It seems likely that they were carried out in
the mid-1920s, probably at the same time that the oak panelling was
applied to the walls of the interior.
An article in The British and Colonial Printer and Stationer’ of 14th
July 1898, includes a photograph showing the ground floor front room
adjacent to Athol Street. It is fitted out as the stationery department
with the shop front as fitted in 1879-1880.
The next major change to the building took place in 1934, when the
Nelson Street premises were demolished to make way for a large new
building running along an extended Nelson Street frontage of sixty
feet. This new building was of striking Art Deco design and still
remains today, although almost unrecognisable under a heavy coat of
pebbledash with extensive alterations to its once handsome
elevations. The building now stands isolated from the Athol Street
premises, a ramp having been created through one of the loading bays
to access a parking area created between the buildings. This has left
the rear elevation of the Athol Street building severed and looking
extremely blank, with only a few upper floor window openings.
The Athol Street elevation, however, remains looking as fine as ever,
although decorative finials on the summit of the building have
disappeared. This elevation is unique in design on the Island and has
been described as being in French chateau style.
The principle elevation is built in red brick and decorated with
limestone. This decoration comprises cills to the first floor pair of
windows, carved panels above these and immediately below the
segmental brick arches. There are also stone string courses, a
matching cornice at second floor level and three decorative stone
roundels inset into the brickwork.
There are recessed panels within the brickwork to either side of the
first and second floor windows, a recessed decorative relief below the
second floor windows and a substantial cornice with ornamental
brickwork below the top floor. The third floor of the building features
a projecting brick dormer with stone decoration; set into a steeply
pitched, slated turret roof designed to be visible from street level. At
ground floor level, the hardwood bow window, with fine glazing bars,
has entrance doors to either side.

A passageway giving direct access to the staircase, without the need to
enter the front office, was created in 1980 when the premises became
a bank. At the same time, at first floor level, new toilet and kitchen
accommodation was created. Velux windows were provided at third
floor level and a strong room in the basement.
Today, internally, very little remains which is of obvious historical
significance. It is possible that some of the sash windows at first or
second floor level maybe original, as could be the staircase. These
facts cannot be verified. Suspended ceilings now hide all original
ceilings. On the rear elevation, replacement windows have been
provided, presumably when the building linking the Athol Street
premises to the Nelson Street premises was removed.
Today, it is impossible to realise the influence that the Isle of Man
Times had on the shaping of the future of the Isle of Man, and the
importance of ‘The Times’ building before the advent of other types of
media. In times of crisis, it is said that large crowds would gather at
‘The Times’ office awaiting news, and this was the case as recently as
1958 following the Winter Hill air disaster.
In World War Two, the building was designated as a centre for the
gathering of information should an invasion of the British Isles have
taken piace.
It is recommended that the former Isle of Man Times office, 9 Athol
Street, Douglas, be added to the Register of Protected Buildings on the
following grounds:
1 High degree of external originality
2 Architectural style unique on the Isle of Man
3 Historical association of the building with the political
development of the Isle of Man, and the prominent Brown’
family who greatly influenced the development of newspapers
and publishing on the Island.
