GAIETY THEATRE, DOUGLAS.
For some time now it has been the intention that we should take forward the Registration
of The Gaiety Theatre. The building has unquestionable merit in terms of its potential for
Registration and attached hereto is a summary of notes extracted from the recent
publication: 4 Full Circle by Roy McMillan. This volume marks the Centenary of the
building in the form that we now know it.
The building is judged worthy of Registration on the following grounds:-
1. Architectural interest and Aesthetic quality;
2. Historic interest and the important part that the building has played in the
development of live Theatre in the Island;
3. Association with the renowned Theatre designer of the time — Frank
Matcham: the building is now one of the best-preserved examples of his work
anywhere.

History of The Gaiety Theatre and Opera House, Douglas, Isle of Man
1971 —Isle of Man Government decided to buy the theatre. It was one of the first
theatres in the British Isles to be rescued by a public authority in this way.
1984 — Mervin Stokes became manager of the theatre and set about completing
restoration.
Dr. David Wilmore was the consultant on the restoration.
“Only a combination of the amateur theatre companies on the Island, the Manx
Government, the first restoration by Victor Glasstone and the creation of The
Friends of The Gaiety that allowed its continued existence.”
The different entrances and exits were used to separate different classes.
“There is a computerised sound and lighting system, yet beneath the stage are
wooden paddles and traps making up one of the most complete examples of
Victorian machinery in the world.”
Has been used as a cinema and iced-over for one-off shows in the past.
Built mainly to satisfy the mass visitors’ need for entertainment in competition
with other theatres and dance halls in such cities as London, Manchester,
Blackpool and Glasgow. Theatre in its Victorian form was booming.
Frank Matcham was the Theatre Designer. ,
In the Gaiety Theatre the air vent is above a glass light known as a sun-burner.
The intense heat causes the air nearest it to rise and allows fresher air to enter.
This was due to the fact that the theatre sat 2000 people and has permitted
smoking in need of expelling.
The Gaiety was the new theatre around the corner from its rival “The Grand”
which was bought twenty years later by The Palace and Derby Castle along with
other properties for some £205,000.
Transition to Gaiety wasn’t smooth and Broadbent sold it in 1898.
Frank Matcham in 1899 conducted negotiations and he presented plans to
Douglas Corporation in March. It was approved at this time, yet no work was
done on the site until the last summer season of the century.
Matcham made the Gaiety light, playful and refreshing as well as “sufficiently
grandiose to appeal to the upper end of the market. Visually rewarding and
o~

perfectly designed to accommodate the masses” and “provide them with a temple
of illusory.”
“The Pavilion was constructed on the Belfast Roof Principle. This involved
hoops of iron forming the basic barrel-vault shape of the building’s skin —
effectively a sturdy Nissen hut. Each main beam was comprised of three metal
plates blocked out for strength and stability with laminated wood, which followed
the curve of the beam rather like a ship’s hull.” Two metal rings either side of
the middle of each beam suggested acrobatics. Dressing rooms either side of
stage, and the Gallery ran all the way around, this and sparse seating gave
impression of large Methodist Hall.
From the outside the Pavilion did not look particularly appealing — ruabon brick
and sandstone decoration.
When the building work began the stage was extended by forty-two feet, which
lead to a reduction in seating capacity which Matcham compensated for by
enlarging the circle and building the gallery. A third level was also added.
Under-stage machinery was put in place by the firm J.L. Killip and Collister of
Tynwald St, Douglas. It was operated by manpower and a collection of winches
and windlasses, counterweights and ropes.
The basic design for The Gaiety Theatre was a century old by the time it was
built.
Italian Renaissance is the general feel, with a Baroque ceiling and Elizabethan
strap work under the circle.
Monday 16" July 1900 — Opening night, with the opening play being “The
Telephone Girl”.
“The Gaiety was recognised as a fine example of its kind, and a first-class
addition to the Palace and Derby Castle Company’s stock. The Stage was big
enough to accommodate opera, and all the spectacular scenery that went with it.”
50s - Serious problems.
60s - Evident action and overhaul were necessary.
70s - Evidence of revival.
90s - Alive and in rude health
After the Second World War film took over the building for the next twenty
years. Nota great success.

The 50s saw scandal and decay, firstly in “Soldiers in Skirts” and the 80s showed
“Steaming” containing nudity.
With the arrival of the Second World War a long, slow decline began. Film was
kept on at The Gaiety but lack of maintenance led to further dilapidation, and in
1957 Douglas Corporation attempted to lease the building and wanted to
encourage live theatre. They decided not to renovate the building and it was seen
simply as a building which could house people and make money.
The Gaiety came within one signature of being demolished, until the declared it as
a “Public service.” ee
In 1971 Tynwald approved the purchase from The Palace and Derby Castle
Company of The Gaiety Theatre for £41,000 and granted permission for a further
£9,000 to be spent on essential repairs.
1976 — Mannin Entertainments freed themselves from the contract when it
became clear that the cost of maintenance would be astronomical and out of reach
of the minor profits the theatre could generate. Government then had to run the
theatre.
Dawn Daly, early 70s remembers first clean-up of theatre. Dress circle bar,
toilets, stage etc all needed a complete re-vamp. Restoration however rather than
re-build.
Victor Glasstone, an architect, theatre consultant and historian was chosen expert
to consult. He asserted that everything should be done to put Gaiety back as
closely as possible to original scheme of decoration.
John Betjeman described theatre as finest outside London.
Much restoration done between 1900-1970. Gaiety left to its own devices from
1978-1990.
Friends of The Gaiety were established in 1978, with the intention of attracting a
larger audience ~ coaches around the Island, radio slot, shows etc. A Sub
Committee formed in 1990 with the aim to restore fabric restoration works and
these restorations went ahead without the theatre having to shut down. Monies -
£3000 from Friends of The Gaiety and through a fund-raising restoration
document from the Isle of Man Bank.
Original backdrop, amphitheatre, seating, sun-bumer and ceiling were restored to
original conditions.
1993 — The exterior of the building received most of its substantial work. Canopy
removed. All work on fagade paid by Manx Government and they provided

N
~
capital funds for major projects too, and an annual subsidy is provided to cover
maintenance of building.
The total number of people going to The Gaiety each year during the restoration
to see a show, averaged over 50,000.
1994 ~ Canopy completed with reinstatement of four large canopy lamps and two
hanging lanterns.
Mechanisms underneath the stage completely recreated, including the Corsican
Trap.
1995 ~ Gallery slips and stalls papered. New emergency lighting installed. The
frieze at the rear of the dress circle was also re-structured.
1996 ~ Quiet year, coffee kiosk behind dress area was removed and replaced with
kiosk designed from pictures of other Matcham bars.
1985 ~ “Manx Last Night of the Proms” first introduced. Generated a substantial
sum for the restoration.
Early 1996 sound reinforcement system installed.
1997 Upgrading of the fire-alarm system.
Stage entirely reboarded.
1998 — Disastrous year. Wet weather lead to water seeping into the left side of
the auditorium. The damp removed all the paper from the amphitheatre level
through the box corridor down as far as the lower part of the stalls. The
government paid for repairs to cladding and supports and insurance covered other
damage.
1979 — Government re-opened the bar, which had previously been used as a
boardroom.
Manager reintroduced barriers, which had previously been used to separate
different classes. Yet these seem to be the only things reinstalled which
encourage a separate class system as changes have yet to be reinstated.
Gaiety is one of the finest examples of what theatre-going in the Victorian age
would have been like.
