Hollybank, Little Switzerland, Douglas - 1895-96
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott
This building is considered worthy of entry in the Protected Buildings
Register being one of the most important works of the internationally
renowned Architect Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Following a period of some three years in spent articles with Maj Charles
E Davis, City Architect of Bath, Baillie Scott accompanied by his recent
Bride, came to the Isle of Man on Honeymoon and during an interview some
years later with John Betjeman, Editor of the Architectural Review, Scott
recalled, "I went to the Isle of Man for a holiday. I was so seasick I
couldn't face the journey back, so I set up practice there’.
In the fullness of time Baillie Scott came to know Archibald Knox the
local born artist whose fame also spread beyond these shores. The two
were later to collaborate in the design and fabrication of architectural
features such as stained glass, copper repoussé fireplace hoods, iron
gates and such like, incorporated into some of Baillie Scotts houses in
the Isle of Man.
Baillie Scott was destined to become an Architect of international repute
designing properties throughout England and as far afield as Switzerland
and Russia.
His works in the Isle of Man form a record of his early development: his
sensitive and creative use of craftsmanship and materials together with a
quite revolutionary approach to internal planning and inter-relationship
of spaces not seen before in English ¢circles.
Whilst on the Island Baillie Scott began submitting illustrated articles
to building magazines, which was “to prove fortunate, as his office
records were later destroyed in two office fires.
Baillie Scott has long been recognised as an Architect of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other

avy
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Webb, Lethaby, Ashbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyens, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.
Accordingly it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Buildings Register.
Built in 1895-86 as a speculative venture this house is one of a pair of
semi-detached houses and represents a departure architecturally from
Baillie Scott's earlier buildings. He turns away from the half-timbered
and brick exteriors to move onto those painted white or coated in harled
rough cast render.
The plan form shows compact dwellings, but ones which still retain a
sense of spaciousness the Dining Hall is the largest reception room and
located centrally overlooking the garden. Five bedrooms are located on
the first floor with a two further rooms in the attic.
The garden elevations exhibit the greatest departure from Baillie Scott's
previous work and we find elegant simplicity in red brick, roughcast
render and tile, this approach is somewhat reminiscent of C.F.A. Voysey
However, Scott's approach to proportion and balance of’ fenestration are
entirely his own and the freshness and spontaneity found in this
composition are most striking.
A conservatory opening of the Dining Hall has been added to the building
in recent years.
Baillie Scott has long been recogiised as an Architect of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more ‘of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Welds, Lethaby Ashhbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyons, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.

Accordingly it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Building Register.
