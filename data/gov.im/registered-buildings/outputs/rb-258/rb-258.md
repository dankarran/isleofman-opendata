Introduction 
 
Cronkbourne Village in Braddan was created by William Fine Moore during the mid-nineteenth 
century, in order to accommodate the families employed at his nearby Tromode Sailcloth 
Factory. 
 
The village comprises the Old School House (which was a community hall containing the school 
room and chapel), a communal green, two rows of workers cottages, plus Cronkbourne House 
where the factory owner lived.  Both rows of workers cottages were Registered on 7th July 
1987 (RB 92), but the hall was not included in the Registration at this time.  It is unclear why 
the hall was not included in this Registration as there is an undated study report for the 
Department (estimated to have been written during the early 1980s), which assessed the then 
proposed Registration of Cronkbourne Village.  This early study report included the following 
extract, which recommended including the Old School House in the Registration of the village; 
 
 
 
The two rows of cottages are parallel to each other and they are separated by the communal 
green.  The community hall (the Old School House) is the central focus of the village and is 
located at its highest point, between the two rows of cottages.  If the houses at Cronkbourne 
were Registered on the basis that they are a unique example of a purpose-built industrial 
community in the Isle of Man, then it would make sense to also Register the hall, as it is an 
important part of the complex.  The hall is not only the central focus architecturally, but it was 
also the central focus socially for the village inhabitants. 
 
To add further weight to the argument for Registration of the hall, it was designed by the 
architect Ewan Christian (1814-1895).  He is famous for restoring Carlisle Cathedral and also for 

  
 
2
designing an extension to the National Gallery in London, along with many schools, churches 
and vicarages both on and off the Island.  He became President of the RIBA in 1884 (the 
highest position of all architects and the only Manxman to have ever held that title), and in 
1887 the RIBA awarded him the Royal Gold Medal. 
 
History 
 
The Moore Family and the Sailcloth Factory 
 
Cronkbourne Village was created by the notable Manx family, the Moores from Cronkbourne 
House.  The family was responsible for the building of the sailcloth factory, along with the 
workers houses in the village, the Old School House and of course their own residence, 
Cronkbourne House. 
 
The origins of the Moore familys sailcloth factory dates back to 1790 when brothers Edward 
and James Moore of Pulrose established a factory in Duke Street, Douglas with their father.  
Following the death of their father in 1810, the Moore brothers dissolved their partnership in 
1814 and both subsequently set up businesses on their own, with Edward based at the old corn 
mill in Tromode and James in Factory Lane, Douglas.  Edward reportedly went bankrupt and his 
Tromode business was bought by his brother James.  James Moore (1772-1846) who took over 
Edwards business, named the area Cronkbourne after the Manx word cronk for hill and the 
English bourne for river and he had Cronkbourne House built nearby as his own home.  
Following James Moores death in 1846, Cronkbourne was inherited by his eldest son Joseph 
Christian Moore, who being Archdeacon of Mann and with no interest in the site, sold the 
business to his brother William Fine Moore. 
 
William Fine Moore (1814-1895) was responsible for the construction of Cronkbourne Village, 
which was made exclusively for the workers of his factory.  He became well-known throughout 
the Island and he was the largest employer of labour (exclusive of the Laxey mines) with a 
keen interest in politics.  He ran the sailcloth factory single-handedly from 1846 to 1877 and it 
was during this period that the business became known throughout the world for the high 
quality of the fabric, with customers including the British Navy and Brunels ship Great Britain.  
Surviving examples of the famous canvas can be seen in the Manx Museum and also on the 
Ramsey-built ship, The Star of India, based in San Diego, California.  The sailcloth produced at 
the Cronkbourne factory was stamped with the three legs of Mann every few yards (MNH, 
2003). 
 
William Fine Moore and his wife Hannah (nee Christian Curwen) had ten children, one of whom 
was the Manx Antiquarian Arthur William Moore.  A.W. Moore (1853-1909) was a prominent 
business figure in the Island during the late nineteenth century.  He held the position of director 
of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and also of the Isle of Man Banking Co, in addition to 
becoming a MHK in 1881 and Speaker of the House of Keys in 1898.  He entered into a 
partnership with his father at the factory in 1877 and this continued until his fathers death in 
1895, after which he ran the factory single-handedly. 
 
In Mercantile Manxland (1900), the production of sailcloth at Cronkbourne was described as 
being the largest and most important industry pursued on the island.., and it was stated 
that ..no sailcloth in the world has a higher fame than that which is still produced at the 

  
 
3
Tromode Sailcloth Works of W.F. Moore & Son.  However, despite these high appraisals of the 
company, sail power simply could not compete with the increasing popularity of steam power 
and the factory went out of business in 1906, ending the Moore familys ownership of 
Cronkbourne. 
 
In 1911 the site was taken over by Clucas Laundry Ltd. in order to address the needs of the 
hotels and guesthouses serving the rapidly growing tourist industry, and during the quiet winter 
months the business was supplemented by brush making.  The owners of Clucas Laundry took 
over the whole of Cronkbourne Village and they also provided housing for their employees as 
the Moores of the sailcloth factory had once done. 
 
By the 1980s the whole site had become rundown and the houses in the village faced 
demolition, but they were saved by Registration status in 1987.  The houses are now owned by 
Braddan Parish Commissioners and although there have been alterations and extensions in 
order to meet the changing needs of the tenants, the properties have retained their original 
facades. 
 
Cronkbourne Village 
 
Cronkbourne Village was created in order to house the factory workers near to their place of 
work and it also provided the factory owner with a degree of social control over his workforce.  
William Fine Moore commissioned his architect brother in law, Ewan Christian to carry out the 
designs of the village, with construction beginning during the 1840s and the work complete in 
1850 (Robinson & McCarroll, 1990). 
 
As landlord and employer, William Fine Moore exercised a large amount of social control over 
the residents of Cronkbourne Village with a list of Rules and Regulations, printed on 1st January 
1850.  The first of his 39 Rules and Regulations insisted that his workforce and their families 
attended church at least every Sunday and it was reported that he [W.F. Moore] always 
looked round carefully to see who was absent. (Douglas M.).  W.F. Moore was a religious man 
and therefore the provision of a church in his village was hugely important to him.  He also 
incorporated a school into the chapel and provided the teacher, in the days long before 
compulsory education.  There was also a Sunday School which was managed by the Misses 
Moore. 
 
Despite his strictness, William Fine Moore was also generous and his workers were rewarded 
with benefits including the school and church house, along with a sick fund, a reading room and 
a wash room.  In addition to this they were also provided with street and domestic lighting from 
1882 (information from Robinson & McCarroll, 1990; plus Mercantile Manxland, 1900). 
 
The majority of the factory workers were from Northern Ireland, with a small number coming 
from the local area.  It has been said that the Manx would not let their children carry out 
dangerous factory work which included crawling between machinery, so the workforce had to 
be brought in from elsewhere.  The Moore family also owned a linen works in Monkstown near 
Belfast, so it is likely that they recruited many of the workers for Cronkbourne from there 
(IOMFHAS, vol.10, no.3). 
 

  
 
4
Another interesting fact about Cronkbourne Village is that the internationally renowned artist 
Archibald Knox was born there to Scottish parents on 9th April 1864.  His father was employed 
as an engineer at the sailcloth factory. 
 
Architecture 
 
Ewan Christian 
 
The architect of the hall was Ewan Christian (1814-1895), who was of Manx descent, related to 
the Christians of Milntown in Lezayre and brother in law to William Fine Moore.  Ewan Christian 
set up his practice in London in 1842 and he was architect to the Church Commissioners from 
1850, being responsible for designing countless churches and vicarages, along with many 
restorations including Carlise Cathedral.  He is perhaps most famous for designing the National 
Portrait Gallery in London, which was an extension to the National Gallery, but he died shortly 
before it opened in 1896.  On the Island, Ewan Christians designs include St. Thomas Church 
in Douglas, Dhoon Church, Christchurch in Laxey, Marown New Church and the Abbey Memorial 
Church in Ballasalla.  William Fine Moore also had Ewan Christian design the interior of his own 
home, Cronkbourne House. 
 
Ewan Christian is one of the most significant architects to have ever worked on the Isle of Man.  
He is noted for being the President of the RIBA from 1884 to 1886 and for receiving their Royal 
Gold Medal in 1887. 
 
The Village 
 
The houses in Cronkbourne Village are in two continuous terraces with a common frontage, 
respective of their row.  The layout creates a self-contained community centred on the village 
green, with the hall being located at the highest point at the head of the village.  A lithograph 
was produced c.1850 showing an idealised view of Cronkbourne Village and the factory.  It 
illustrated the Old School House correctly, but the houses in the village were portrayed as much 
larger than they were actually completed. 
 
The Old School House 
 
The construction of the chapel and school house was funded by W.F. Moore, who also retained 
ownership of the building afterwards.  The chapel opened on 18th December 1850 and it was 
used as a Chapel of Ease to Braddan Parish Church, with it being serviced by the curate of 
Braddan.  The maintenance of the building was the responsibility of W.F. Moore, and after him, 
his son A.W. Moore (IOM Victorian Society, letter 22/08/08). 
 
The Old School House continued to be used as a Chapel of Ease for many years following the 
closure of the sailcloth factory.  However, the congregation numbers dwindled and the Chapel 
was closed in 1964 before finally being sold in 1967 (Douglas M.).  Today the building has been 
converted into offices and it accommodates an architectural studio, with internal alterations 
taking place. 
 
The Old School House is a rectangular building standing on a site sloping upwards away from 
the village.  It has a simple design and can be recognised as a Ewan Christian creation by its 

  
 
5
similarities to Christchurch in Dhoon and Christchurch in Laxey.  The walls of the building are 
constructed with Manx slate stone and the roof is high pitched with a natural slate covering.  
There are two entrances, one on the lower floor of the eastern elevation, which faces towards 
the village and the other through a porch extension on the upper floor of the western elevation.  
The style of the architecture on the main or eastern elevation can be described as Early 
English church architecture, with its narrow pointed arch headed windows and the arch headed 
door.  This is reflected to a lesser extent on the western elevation with the arch headed window 
on the porch entrance to the upper floor here.  On the remaining north and south elevations 
the architecture is much simpler, with more of the design given to the functional use of the 
building.  All of the window original window openings are judged to have been retained with the 
exception of some of those on the lower floor of the northern elevation, which have been 
altered as a result of the changing use of the building to offices.  These alterations are as 
follows starting from the external left hand side; a small window has been created here for an 
internal w.c., the next window opening is an original which appears to have been made wider, 
the next is an original window opening which has not been altered and the last would have 
originally been a window opening the same as the one before, but it has now been made into a 
door.  On the southern elevation there are three buttresses which were added in the past in 
order to stabilise the building (PA 91/000108/B).  The buttresses have a cement render so they 
are of a different appearance to the stone walls of the building, but blend in to an extent with 
the grey colour of the stones.  As the buttresses are hidden from the main view of passers by, 
they are not judged to be too detrimental to the overall appearance of the building. 
 
There was originally a bellcote atop the eastern elevation of the Old School House, similar to 
those seen on other Manx churches designed by Ewan Christian, including Christchurch in 
Dhoon and Christchurch in Laxey.  The bellcote faced towards the village and the bell was rung 
to call the residents to church.  This feature was removed at some point between the early 
1980s when the buildings were photographed and researched for the Department and 1987 
when photographs were taken of the houses in the village relating to their Registration, 
confirming that the bellcote had been removed.  The bell itself was removed from the top and 
is now located at mid-way point up the wall of the eastern elevation. 
 
The building has landmark qualities within the local area, as it is at the head of the village and 
provides an important visual link between the two rows of cottages.  Architecturally, the 
external changes to the property are limited, but in summary they include the removal of the 
bellcote from the eastern elevation (the bell is now located half way up the elevation), 
alterations to some of the window openings on the lower floor of the northern elevation and the 
addition of the buttresses to the southern elevation.  However, despite these changes it can be 
argued that the Registered houses in the village have also undergone alterations in order to 
meet the modern needs of their tenants, and these changes have not been detrimental to the 
uniformity or group value of the village. 
 
Age and Rarity 
 
Cronkbourne Village is the only example of a purpose-built industrial community in the Isle of 
Man.  There are comparable examples of nineteenth century industrial housing in such places 
as Port Sunlight in Merseyside which was built by the Lever Brothers for the workers of their 
soap factory, Saltaire in West Yorkshire which was built by Titus Salt for the workers of his 
woollen mills, and Bourneville near Birmingham, which was built for the workers of the nearby 

  
 
6
Cadburys chocolate factory.  Despite the fact that Cronkbourne Village is a much smaller 
example of an industrial community, it pre-dates all of these examples and is a fine example of 
early planning in the Island. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATION 
 
The loss of the Old School House in Cronkbourne Village would be detrimental to the whole 
fabric of the historic village and the points raised in this study clarify why the building is worthy 
of protection by the Department.  An alternative to Registration would be to designate 
Cronkbourne Village as a Conservation Area, which could include the area consisting of both the 
workers cottages and the hall.  The village was not originally given Conservation Area status 
when the houses were Registered in 1987 because it was simply not an option at that time, as 
the Department did not begin to designate Conservation Areas until 1990.  However, at this 
stage Conservation Area status may not be a likely alternative due to the already Registered 
status of the workers cottages.  Therefore, the Old School House is suggested for inclusion on 
the Protected Buildings Register for the following reasons; 
 
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality 
 
• 
The building was designed by the architect Ewan Christian.  He is noted for designing 
countless churches throughout Britain, restoring Carlisle Cathedral, designing an 
extension to the National Gallery in London, being President of the RIBA from 1884 to 
1886 and for being awarded to RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1887. 
 
Historic Interest 
 
• 
Cronkbourne Village is the only example of a purpose-built industrial community in the 
Isle of Man. 
 
• 
The village has connections with important periods in the Islands history, including its 
industrial history and the age of sail boats, when canvas produced here was used by 
ships throughout the world.  In addition to this, the village is a reminder of when Clucas 
Laundry Ltd. owned the site and the workers in the community were an important 
support to the Islands once booming tourist industry. 
 
Close Historic Association 
 
• 
The village was created by the Moore family of Tromode who ran the nearby sailcloth 
factory.  William Fine Moore (1814-1895) was responsible for the establishment of the 
village.  He was a successful businessman, well-known throughout the Island and made 
the sailcloth produced at his factory known throughout the world.  His son Arthur 
William Moore (1853-1909) ran the factory after him and he was also a prominent 
business figure, being the director of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and also of the 
Isle of Man Banking Co, in addition to becoming a MHK in 1881 and Speaker of the 
House of Keys in 1898. 
 

  
 
7
• 
The famous Manx artist Archibald Knox was born in Cronkbourne Village on 9th April 
1864.  His father was employed at the sailcloth factory. 
 
• 
An example of the canvas produced by the workers of Cronkbourne Village survives on 
the ship known as the Star of India.  This famous ship was built in Ramsey shipyard in 
1863 and was originally named Euterpe.  She is fully restored and now a seaworthy 
museum ship in the San Diego Maritime Museum in California, USA.  She is claimed to 
be the oldest ship which still sails regularly and the oldest iron hulled merchant ship still 
on the sea. 
 
Landmark Qualities 
 
• 
The landmark value of the building is limited to the local area.  It is centrally located at 
the head of the village and therefore it provides an important visual link between the 
two rows of workers cottages. 
 
Group Value 
 
• 
In terms of architectural grouping and value to the Islands heritage, Cronkbourne 
Village is of paramount importance.  Its main significance is as an industrial village unit 
and not as individual buildings.  As the central building architecturally and also the 
location of the residents social, spiritual and schooling requirements, the Old School 
House was therefore the central focal point within the village unit. 
 
• 
To add further weight to the group value of Cronkbourne Village, most of the surviving 
buildings in the village are already Registered, including the workers cottages (RB 92), 
Cronkbourne House (the home of W.F. Moore, RB 153) and parts of the old factory 
including an old chimneystack and engine room (RB 222). 
 
Age and Rarity 
 
• 
Cronkbourne Village dates from the 1840s and as such, it pre-dates famous examples of 
industrial housing found in the UK, such as Port Sunlight in Merseyside, Saltaire in West 
Yorkshire and Bourneville near Birmingham.
