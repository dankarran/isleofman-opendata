REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: The Ornamental Gateway
ADDRESS: Marine Drive, Braddan
POST CODE: N/A
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Braddan Commissioners
GRID REF: 386 747
Introduction / History
By the 1880's Douglas Head was developing as a place of recreation for the growing
visiting industry. Access to the Head was by steam ferry or by a circuitous route via
Douglas Bridge. To cater for the crowds, bold plans were laid for the building of a
Suspension Bridge and Tower. The intention was to improve access and further
increase the attraction of the Head. Both schemes were wildly ambitious and ran into
early trouble, but the linked proposal for the creation of a Marine Drive running south-
west from the top of the Head Road gathered momentum. At the end of 1890, the
Drive was ‘set out’ and construction commenced. Work proceeded speedily and by late
July 1891, the Drive was ready to be opened by Lieutenant Governor Walpole. The
highlight of the ceremony was his unlocking of the ornamental gates built near to the
commencement of the Marine Drive. Of all the buildings on the Head at the time the
Gatehouse was the most spectacular, being an architectural statement in the romantic
tradition.
In July 1896, after long gestation, the Douglas Southern Electric Tramway opened. It
followed the course of the Marine Drive, and the double-deck cars passed under the
landward archway of the Gatehouse. It operated until the Second World War and was
taken up in the early 1950's. Further drastic change followed later with the removal of
the gatekeeper’s cottage which used to be attached to the seaward side of the arches.
A substantial house with outbuildings and a steep kitchen garden, it had a dramatic
skyline with gables, finials, ornamental chimneys and a slate spirelet. Though the
demolition removed an important element of the original composition, the main part
survives, and the scars have been adequately disguised.
Architecture
There is a long history of castellated buildings on the Isle of Man which goes back
much further than the Gothic Revival of the mid-19" Century. The Castle Mona (1805)
set the fashion for the Scottish castellated style, which to some extent Inspired the
Tower of Refuge (1832) and Falcon Cliff (1846) and many more. Wherever there was
a prominent site, the first choice would be to create a romantic composition with
castellations. The builders of the Marine Drive followed this tradition, employing a
dramatic High Gothic style. The main elements were twin archways over the
carrilageways of the Drive flanked by rugged towers with corbels and machicolations.
These latter rise to the centre like Scottish ‘corbie steps’ further enhancing the
complicated outline. Dressed sandstone is used for the architectural elements and for
the rustic lettering over the gateways, between which is the datestone, reading

‘Marine Drive 1891’. The orange brown freestone contrasts with the locally quarried
slate flags which form the main building material.
The Gatehouse is quite an architectural tour de force and its design has been
attributed to Maxwell and Tuke of King Street, Manchester who were associated with
the later stages of the Marine Drive development. Their chief claim to fame is that
they were at this time designing the Blackpool Tower complex. With more mundane
commissions they were noted for an eclectic use of many different styles, and the
Marine Drive Gatehouse is no exception, being an example of their facility with
romantic architecture. a
Recommendation
The Ornamental Gateway is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings
Register for the following reasons;
Architectural Interest — One of the most prominent examples of the romantic
castellated style adopted throughout the 19" Century as landmarks or as architectural (
statements. A lavish example of its kind, it is the best entrance feature to have
survived on the Isle of Man and an important landmark in the history of the Isiand’s
tourist development. A dramatic composition by the architects Maxwell and Tuke of
Manchester
Close Historic Association - With the development of Douglas Head, the Marine
Drive and the Douglas Southern Electric Tramway. Apart from the recently restored
Camera Obscura, the Gateway is now the only substantial building to have survived
from the tourist heyday of Douglas Head.
As the work of Maxwell and Tuke, the gateway has links with their other ambitious
ventures, notably the Blackpool Tower complex and the scheme to raise the
Manchester Royal Infirmary on Eiffel Tower —type legs.
Group Value_ - Though separated by three miles, the Gateway has its counterpart in
the prefabricated tollhouse at the other end of the Marine Drive at Port Soderick,
which has survived virtually intact.
Rarity - With its southern counterpart, the pair are now unique as roadside toil
buildings on the Isle of Man. In the Victorian period there were several castellated and (
romantic buildings on prominent sites and key points. This is one of the best to have
survived, albeit without its attached tollhouse, and it is now the only road arch on the
Island.
