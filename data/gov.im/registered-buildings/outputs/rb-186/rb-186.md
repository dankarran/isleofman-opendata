NORTH QUAY

DOUGLAS HOTEL, NORTH QUAY, DOUGLAS
The Douglas Hotel dates back to 1759, when an Ulsterman called Robert Black leased
a parcel of land, with a frontage of 64 feet to the quay, from the Duke of Athol. He
then built an extremely imposing residence on this leased plot. Black was a leading
merchant who traded in wines and spirits from Bordeaux. He brought these to the
Island, paying only the minimal duty levied, then running his goods to England to
avoid the much higher duties that were levied there.
In 1765, however, his trade was brought to an end when the Island passed into the
hands of the Crown and its customs’ officers moved to the Island. Black sold the
property to Dr Curphy in 1774, but it was occupied by Peter John Heywood, at one
time a Deemster and also owner of the Nunnery, who sold the same to the Taubmans
of Castletown. Following his death, his widow occupied the property until 1791.
The property then stood empty until 1793, when the 4th Duke of Athol acquired the
lease from Dr Curphy, and used it as his residence on the Island during the building
of the Castle Mona. In 1808, the Duke disposed of the whole block to his Receiver
General, William Scott. It was described as: ‘the dwelling house formerly called
Black’s House but lately called the Duke’s house... with the Lord’s old warehouse...
and the new storehouse’. Scott carried out considerable redevelopment to the
property. He constructed two additional, large dwellings fronting the quay; these
remain as the Clarendon Hotel and Isle of Man Farmers. Scott let the Duke’s former
house to the Imperial Customs Service and it became known as Customs House. It is
shown as the Custom House on Wood’s plan of Douglas of 1833.
Around 1862, the Customs Service vacated the building, it became licensed and was
known as the Old Customs House Inn, the name being changed to the Douglas Hotel
before 1867. In 1867, Scott’s trustees sold his properties by auction, the Douglas
Hotel being purchased by Thomas Fleming. An application to Douglas Corporation
for alterations in 1893 showed Fleming to still be the owner, but by the time of the
next located application in 1935, Heron & Brearley had become the owners.
The property which extends over basement, ground, three upper floors and attic has an
impressive five-bay frontage to North Quay, with a four-bay side elevation which
would have looked out over the Market Place until construction of the Fish Market at
the turn of the century. These principle elevations give the impression of a vast
structure, but the limitations of the original site are made clear from the rear elevation.
It is considered likely that the reason the building was built with such an irregular rear
elevation was to fit around buildings already occupying this part of the site.
Documentation from the 17th century refers to the Lord’s stable and ‘cellar’ or
storehouse. It appears that these buildings were erected in the late 1660s, and were a
long narrow structure approximately 23 feet deep externally. They were situated
along the northern boundary of the site, which is today occupied by the Douglas and
Clarendon Hotels and the Isle of Man Farmers. It is considered likely that these
buildings were the ones that influenced the irregular rear boundary referred to above.
This likelihood is reinforced on site by two pieces of evidence.

Firstly, the cellars of the 1759 building have regular level ceilings, with timber joists
supporting the floors above. There is, however, access through these cellars to a
series of vaulted cellars which are at a lower level. These cellars are situated below
the Victorian rear extension which has suspended timber floors and derive no support
from the vaulting as would a flagged floor. The vaulted cellars run at right angles to
the quay. There would seem to be no obvious reason to construct cellars at a different
level and in a different style to those adjacent. There is also no reason for them to be
vaulted, when the building above them makes no use of this vaulting. The most likely
conclusion is that the vaulted cellars substantially pre-date the 1759 building and may
in fact date to the mid seventeenth century, the date of similar forms of cellars found
in Peel. There is every reason to believe that these storage areas formed part of the
Lord’s cellar.
The presence of earlier building forms is further re-enforced by findings at the half-
landing level between the first and second floors. Here there is access to a roof void
over the Victorian extension. In the void are three rearward facing windows to the
second floor of the 1759 building; these have now been blocked. Below them is a
distinct marking on the rear wall indicative of the roofline of a building long removed
to facilitate construction of the extension.
In order to determine if the vaulted cellars do, indeed, form part of the Lord’s cellar
dating from the 1660s, it would be necessary to inspect any adjacent cellars of the Isle
of Man Farmers and Clarendon Hotel. The special historic interest of this aspect of
the building is also considered to be of such importance as to warrant specialist
archaeological advice on the importance of the cellars and to accurately date them. At
the time of inspection the cellars in question were flooded to a depth of approximately
6 inches and contained much debris. It is understood, however, that the cellars do dry.
The Douglas Hotel is constructed principally in local stone, but in the cellars and roof
void to the rear extension evidence of the use of brick was noted. External wall
surfaces are rendered with a spa-dash finish, the side elevation having only been
recently applied. There is a smooth rendered plinth at ground floor level.
There are rendered quoins at each corner of the building and a parapet on the front
elevation obscures accommodation at attic floor level. During its recent past the slate
roof finish has been replaced with concrete tiles, whilst rainwater goods are of cast
iron and PVCu sections. There are railings to the front of the building that appear to
be modern.
The quayside elevation of the building can be seen on Meredith’s engraving of 1805,
this shows the five-bay arrangement that we see today. There are apparently windows
in the gable then visible, but now obscured by the adjacent building. The front
elevation has changed little since the first photographs of the building taken in the late
19th century. The detailing around the main entrance door and cornice above remain,
although string course mouldings below first floor windows have been removed. The
cill height of the first floor windows has been lifted and their style changed from 6 on
9, Georgian, to simple 2-pane sliding sash. On the second floor, four of the five
windows retain Georgian-style glazing bars, whilst on the third floor the style has
again been changed. The secondary access on the front elevation has been blocked up
in recent years.

The side elevation has been extensively altered. Victorian photographs show four
windows at each level above the ground floor. Several of these have today been
blocked up, as has a door at ground floor level. Recently a fire escape, which is
totally out of sympathy with this historic building, has been installed with an escape
door at first floor level.
The rear elevation has been the subject of extensive alteration over the years. There is
a two-storey rear extension that must have been built prior to 1882, when the concert
room was said to be: ‘the most handsome and largest on the Island.’ W J Rennison on
behalf of Thomas Fleming, submitted plans on 30th January 1893, to make minor
alterations to this rear extension. At the time these plans were drawn, there were two
rear entrances. These entrances now house window openings, whilst a window
opening has been enlarged to provide double entrance doors into a hallway that was
formerly the smoke-room.
At ground floor level, the layout today is essentially as it was following the 1935
alterations. On the upper floors, what are believed to be original components can be
" seen, these include the staircase, roof trusses, 10 inch wide floorboards and possibly
skirting boards, architraves, doors and some rear windows.
On the third floor, the condition of the building deteriorates markedly. There has
been extensive water penetration that has brought down plasterwork to ceilings. This
has created ideal conditions for timber decay, which has occurred in some areas.
These problems require urgent attention.
Externally, although the property has been subject to many changes during its life, it
still retains its imposing presence on the Douglas Quayside. The Douglas would
benefit greatly from a programme of careful refurbishment. Encouragement should
be given as part of any such programme to return the principle elevation to the quay to
its original appearance.
The Douglas Hotel is judged worthy of addition to the Register of Protected
Buildings on the following grounds:-
1 Age - the property above ground is known to date from 1759: the vaulted
cellars are believed to date from the late 1660’s. These would be much the
oldest surviving properties in Douglas.
2 Historic interest - the building has played an important part in the
historical] development of the town and port of Douglas. The building
represents one of the most substantial legacies ef the ‘Running Trade’
and is a genuine survival of this part of the Island’s history. The property
also has historical links with persons of national importance including
Peter John Heywood (1739 — 1790) and the Duke of Athol who each used
the property as their dwelling house for some time.
