Historical Notes 
 
The 2000 seat Crescent Super Cinema, built in 1900 on the site of the earlier all-wooden 
Picturedrome (part of the Peirrot Village), was the biggest and also the most decorated.  Its interior 
was like that of a Tudor castle with imitation tapestry walls.  Its stage, which could be used for 
theatrical requirements and did so occasionally, was styled like a portcullis.  There was proposals to 
build a new theatre, shopping arcade and winter garden alongside the Crescent on the site of the Peirrot 
Pavilion but the onset of the Great Depression in the Thirties put paid to that.  The pavilion remained 
and did so until the 1960s.
