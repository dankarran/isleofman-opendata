REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Crofton,
ADDRESS: The Crofts, Castletown
POST CODE: IM9 LW
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Castletown Commissioners
GRID REF: 263 675
Introduction
In July 1850, John Moore Jeffcott, Advocate, purchased the site of Crofton which was then a
garden, from the beneficiaries of the will of the late John Roland Jones, Surgeon of Castletown.
The land, on which The Coach House now stands, was purchased in April 1854 from William
and Rebecca Cubbon. Crofton was built sometime between 1850 and 1861, when the census
revels that John Moore Jeffcott was resident at the property.
John Moore Jeffcott became a member of the House of Keys in 1855, and was returned to the
Reformed House as member of Castletown in 1867, a position he held until 1882 when he
retired. It would appear that Jeffcott fell upon hard times, as in October 1885 he and his wife
Lucy, entered into a deed that assigned and conveyed their real estate to trustees, to be sold to
satisfy charges upon it. In respect of Crofton, Jeffcott and his wife had in May 1885, entered
into a deed of bond and security on mortgage to Elizabeth Myichreest for the sum of £200. The
above deed contained a provision that if the other properties within the deed realised sufficient
funds to satisfy the amount outstanding, then Crofton would not be put up for sale and would
be retained by the Jeffcotts.
Unfortunately this was not the case, and on the 5" February 1886 the property was sold by
auction, and was purchased by Doctor John Clague for the sum of £1,000. Itis believed that
Doctor Clague practised as a physician from the premises, and whilst is cannot be established, it
does appear likely that it was he who erected the rear extension to provide sufficient space for
a waiting room and surgery. Doctor Clague died in 1908, and following his wife's death in
1911, her executors sold Crofton to Daniel Haigh Hesslegrave, included in the conveyance was
the small field attached. Daniel Hesslegrave died in 1916, and Crofton was passed in his will to
his son, Daniel Wood Hesslegrave, but was subject to the life tenancy of Edith Ann Ditchfieid
who died in 1948.
The property was next sold in February 1952, when Jessie Margaret Watkin purchased it from
Daniel Wood Hesslegrave and his wife Nora. Mrs Watkin held the property for twenty-five
years, until it was purchased in 1997 by Alfred Howard Simcocks and his wife Alice Hall
Simcocks, In the same year Mr and Mrs Simcocks sold The Coach House to Robert Fred
Jackson. In 1990, Anthony Clayton Ashworth and Margaret Alice Ashworth purchased Crofton

from Mr and Mrs Simcocks, and in the same year also purchased The Coach House from
Richard Dennis to reunite the property. Crofton was sold in 1999 to Mr and Mrs Lee, who are
the current owners.
It is possible to date Crofton fairly accurately to between 1851, when Jeffcott purchased the
widow right of Helen Jones, the widow of the late John Roland Jones and 1861, when the
census reveals him to be fiving at Crofton. The property has in the past been linked with
Thomas Brine, but as Brine died in 1840 it is highly unlikely that he was involved in its design.
The date of the first two-storey extension to Crofton is not known, but it does seem likely that it
was extended during the ownership of Doctor Clague. Certainly on the Ordinance Survey Map
of 1878, the property has not been extended.
The first extension was full width to the rear elevation, over two storeys with a single pitched
roof. This fits in neatly beneath the eaves of the original three-storey house. Mr and Mrs
Simcocks carried out some remodelling to the interior of the house in 1977. These works
included the provision of a new kitchen, utility room, cloakroom and a new bathroom in what
had previously been a small bedroom in the centre of the first floor. At the same time, first-
floor fireplaces, pelmets and picture rails were removed. A single-storey rear extension was
buift during Mr and Mrs Ashworth’s occupation in the early 1990's.
Crofton is built throughout in focal limestone. The original part of the property has a twin
pitched roof, whilst the two-storey rear extension is mono pitched, and the single-storey
extension has a hipped roof. The roof is variously clad in natural slate and asbestos slate, and
there is a large eaves overhang. The front elevation has a three-storey central section, with a
pitched roof at right angles to the main roof, with dormers to either side. On the rear elevation,
there is a single peaked projection at second-floor level, situated between the twin rendered
chimney stacks.
The dormers to the front elevation are very interesting and unusual. They extend down below
the eaves level, and have a decorative support corbel beneath each of them. There is a
decorative string-banding course above the ground-floor windows, which extends over the front
porch. The porch is recessed with pilasters to either side, and features a heavy entrance door
with lights to both side and a matching fanlight above.
The windows to Crofton are a particular feature, being probably unique. Whilst not all are
original, those that are replacements have been impeccably constructed to replicate those
which they have replaced.
The property has three reception rooms, all of which have fireplaces, the marble fireplace to the
dining room being particularly noteworthy.
The drawing is panelled to dado level, and several rooms retain original shutters.
The dining room retains what appears to be its original heavily moulded ceiling centre, and a
very unusual moulded cornice. There is a fourth reception room (morning room), which was
added to the property approximately twelve years ago. This has been created in keeping with

the rest of the property. Other ground-floor accommodation includes: a modern kitchen, a rear
passageway that was formed from the original kitchen, a conservatory and shower room.
Many of the joinery items to the ground floor appear original, including doors, architraves and
skirting boards. There is a basement, which houses the study and utility room (a fuel store still
has its coal chute), A wide staircase, with substantial newel posts and handrails rises to the
haif-landing level, where access is gained to the first extension through a pair of half-glazed
doors. This currently houses a bedroom, toilet and bathroom. .
The staircase rises to first-floor level, where some rearrangement of the original
accommodation has been undertaken, before continuing to second-floor level, where there is a
further bedroom and storage accommodation.
The property is well set back from the Crofts, to which it makes a substantial contribution to the
streetscape. There are heavy cast iron railings with twin entrance gates, which are a particular
feature of the property.
As the Coach House has been extensively rebullt in recent years, it is not considered necessary
to include it within the curtilage of the property for registration purposes. The fact that the
property is situated within the Conservation Area is sufficient to prevent inappropriate exterior
works that would be prejudicial to Crofton.
Crofton, The Crofts, Castletown is considered worthy of addition to the Protected Buildings
Register by reason of the following:
Architectural Interest and / or Aesthetic Quality:
Although the architect for Crofton is not known, the quality of the design is exemplary and
considered worthy of protection via Registration.
Close Historical Association:
With John Moore Jeffcott, member for the House of Keys between 1855 and 1885.
Group Value:
Elderbank, Westwood and Crofton comprise and important architectural unity within the street
scene of this part of the Castletown Conservation Area.
