Register entry description 
History 
Built in the 1889, the lighthouse was constructed to the seaward side of the main (Robert 
Stephenson designed) lighthouse as a further maritime warning measure given the 
accumulation of shingle and gravel since the main lighthouse had been completed in 1818. 
In 1950, the lighthouse was repositioned further in a seaward, North-Easterly direction, with 
the historic section raised and mounted on a concrete lower section and base. 
The light signal was discontinued in April 2010. 
Details 
MATERIALS: Concrete base with permanent metal shuttering. Painted concrete tower, with 
metal lantern section and balcony. Glazing to lantern room. 
PLAN: The property is octagonal, set on a square shuttered concrete base. The structure 
tapers towards its head. 

 
 
EXTERIOR: A concrete base with permanent shuttering raises the structure above the beach 
level. The lower half of the tower is plain in form, with a maintenance access door on its 
landward face. The upper section sits inboard of the lower section, with a balcony/walkway 
surround to the lantern room. The balcony-like structure between the upper and lower 
sections is the original base of the lighthouse prior to its repositioning and raising in 1950. The 
lantern room glazing is formed of triangular panes inverted alternately. 
 
INTERIOR: Three levels, with painted metal ladders providing circulation between each level. 
Ground and first floor level have white painted vertical timber boarding, with circular metal 
windows housed within square openings. The lantern room (second floor) has no lighting 
equipment, having been removed when the light was decommissioned. A small metal door 
gives access to the external balcony. 
 
 
Reason for Registration Decision 
 
The Point of Ayre Winkie Lighthouse, Bride, is recommended for entry into the Protected 
Buildings Register for the following reasons: 
●ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST:  
Rare example of a cast iron lighthouse from the 19th century. 
●HISTORIC INTEREST:  
The structure is a surviving example of the technology used to prevent maritime disasters in 
the late 19th century, the need for such measures increased as a result of the island’s growing 
development during the 19th century.
