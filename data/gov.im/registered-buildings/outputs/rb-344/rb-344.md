Register Entry Summary – Former Kirk Michael Railway Station
Details 
Name: Former Kirk Michael Railway Station (now Kirk Michael Fire Station) 
Location: Station Road, Kirk Michael IM6 1EZ 
Register Entry Number: 344 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025
For the avoidance of doubt, registration is limited to the former railway station passenger building. 
The former goods shed, now appliance house, is not included. In addition, the modern partitions and 
additions that were installed during the building’s conversion to a Fire Station, together with the 
modern fixtures and fittings that are in place in connection with the building’s current Fire Station 
use are not included in this registration. 
History 
The station building was in place when the Manx Northern Railway opened for traffic on 23rd 
September 1879. The building is presumed to be a design of W H Thomas of Westminster, who was 
responsible for many of the line’s other buildings. As well as serving one of the principal population 
centres on the line, the station at Kirk Michael also catered for passengers wishing to visit the 
recreation grounds in nearby Glen Wyllin. As a result of falling traffic levels, the St John’s to Ramsey 
line was closed on 13th November 1965. The line (and Kirk Michael station) opened again in 1967, 
before closing for the last time on 6th September 1968. After this date, the line was used periodically 
for the transport of oil tanks until October 1969, before finally being lifted in 1974. 
The station buildings gained a new lease of life when the site was adapted for use as the village’s Fire 
Station in 1981, a use that has continued to the present day. The former goods shed has been 
significantly extended and altered to be used as the Fire Appliance House. Although the principal 
station building has also been adapted for use as the offices and crew facilities for the fire station, 
the building has retained its distinctive Sandstone finish together with much of its historic form, 
materials and elements of historic detailing.  
Details 
MATERIALS: Principally constructed of Peel Sandstone, with timber roof carcase, barge boards and 
eaves brackets. Roofs are finished in Cambrian slate. Historic windows have been replaced with 
modern UPVC units, principal entrance door is painted timber. 
FORM: The building features twin gables with steeply pitched roofs either side of a central three-bay 
section, with a further single storey portion extending off the centre of the northern wall. Roofs are 
steep-pitched with bargeboards featuring vertical and horizontal cross bracing and triangular eaves 
brackets. The outrigger off the northern wall now features a pitched roof that was not present when 
the railway station was operational. Windows have been replaced with UPVC units, although the 
historic pattern of glazing has been retained. Now in use at the Kirk Michael Fire Station, the 
principal entrance opens in to the canteen, with access through to an office in the southern section, 
kitchen and wash room in the northern section, and toilets in the northern outrigger. A small 
enclosed yard area is situated to the rear of the northern outrigger. The building’s two stone-built 
chimney stacks have been overpainted with a modern water-proofing product. 

Reasons for Registration 
The Former Kirk Michael Railway Station is entered into the Protected Buildings Register for the 
following reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST 
•
Built in a distinctive style with a local Sandstone wall finish and featuring twin steep-pitched 
gables (a design attributed to W H Thomas of Westminster), the building is a nationally 
important example of its type, retaining much of its historic architectural design, decoration 
and craftsmanship including its Sandstone wall finish, painted timber barge boards, vertical 
and horizontal gable bracing, and triangular eaves brackets.
HISTORIC INTEREST 

Dating from the opening of the Manx Northern Railway in 1879, prior to the widespread use
of private motor vehicles the building was the main point of arrival for passengers, goods
and visitors to Kirk Michael and Glen Wyllin. As such the station played an important part in
the social, economic, transport and tourism history of Kirk Michael and the surrounding
area.
