REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Westwood
ADDRESS: The Crofts, Castletown
POST CODE: IM9 1LW
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Castletown Commissioners
GRID REF: 262 675
Introduction
Following the purchase by the British crown of the rights of the Duke of Athol in 1828, the
Lord’s or Governor’s Garden was sold by the Department of Woods and Forests to Thomas
Brine on the 7 August 1835. Brine paid £300 for the land, which was described as ‘A parcel of
garden-ground in Castletown, and all right of the King’s majesty in and to all that parcel of
unenclosed land lying between the garden-ground and the new road to Malew Street’.
Thomas Brine was a notable architect on the Isle of Man, and died in an accident in Castletown
Square in 1840.
Westwood was built in the early 1840's on part of the land purchased, and Thomas Brine’s
widow, Ann, sold the remainder of the land in two parcels. Ann Brine entered into a Deed of
Mortgage in August 1844 with James Holmes, the deed contained the wording: ‘All that garden
situate in Castletown which was purchased by my late husband..... together with that dwelling
house and offices by me lately erected thereon’. It is therefore, possible to date Westwood to a
period between January 1840 and August 1844.
It is not know whether Thomas Brine designed Westwood prior to his death, but this is clearly a
possibility. In 1853, Ann Brine passed the property to here trustees, one of which was the
Reverend W B Christian, her son-in-law. This bond and security was passed to James Gell in
the following year. In March 1857, Ann Brine sold Westwood by auction, together with a field
at the West End of Arbory Street. These were knocked down to the Reverend William Bell
Christian, vicar of Lezayre, who was the highest bidder.
In February 1863, Reverend Christian sold the property to William Thomas Henry Cudd, who
only owned the property for two years. In April 1865 he and his wife, Isobella, sold the
property at a substantial profit to Charlotte Woods, widow of Balladoole. In 1984, Doctor John
Clague, physician, of Crofton, the neighbouring property, purchased Westwood from Richard
Ambrose Woods and his wife, Emma, who has inherited the property from Charlotte Woods.

When Doctor Clague died in 1908, the property passed to his wife who died in February 1911.
In her will she left the property to the five daughters of Tom Corrin of the Parade Castletown.
They sold the property to John William Travis Cocker, a cotton merchant from Chester. In
February 1935, Cocker and his wife conveyed the property to William Edwin Grimshaw, who
died intestate.
His son, James William Travis Grimshaw inherited and gifted Westwood to his mother, Elizabeth
Grimshaw, for the consideration of five Shillings. Elizabeth Grimshaw then sold the property to
Elizabeth Milne-Smith; John Henry Sides; and the Right Honourable Peter Patrick Fitzroy Martin
Fifth Baron Hemphill from Galway. Elizabeth Milne-Smith sold her interest to the other two
parties in 1957, and Foley R S P Verker acquired the property in 1973. The property then
passed through a very complicated series of trust unit it was sold in 1997 to Fiona J Winter, but
this purchase excluded The Coach House. The property was sold to Mr and Mrs Graham in
2001, and they are the current owners of the property.
Westwood has a very imposing front facade, set back behind decorative cast iron railings. The
front and side elevations, which are visible from The Crofts, are smooth cement rendered with
horizontal grooving to the lower section of the front elevation. The property has plain Victorian-
style sliding sash windows, and a most attractive front entrance portico, supported on
cylindrical columns. There is a large decorative corbelled eaves overhang, and the house has
been extended on its northern side, with both single and two-storey extensions, the dates of
which cannot be verified.
On its rear elevation, the property has remained unrendered, and is constructed in local
limestone. Some of the sash windows to the rear feature a small-pane Georgian-style glazing.
The roof to the property is pitched, being slate clad, and there are two dormers and two
skylights on the rear elevation. Both chimney stacks are cement rendered.
It is unfortunate that the interior of the property has been extensively refitted, and little of the
original interior now remains. The entrance hall is approached through a very heavy door,
which may well be original with its original latch and handle set.
The entrance hall has a plaster archway, which appears original, and gives access to the
drawing room which faces The Crofts, and now incorporates the room to the rear, which looks
out over the rear garden. An arch between these two rooms has been opened up to create a
single through room, In the rear section is a modern fireplace and modern French doors. Both
rooms have plairi moulded cornice, and the shutters are still present to the windows on the
front elevation, but sealed up.
On the opposite side of the hallway is the dining room, which again has a modern fireplace and
deep skirting boards that could be original. A doorway from the dining room enters a single-
storey storeroom that has been added.
To the rear of the dinning room is a sitting room, which has been entirely refitted and this gives
access to the kitchen, which is single storey and has again been refitted. The two-storey
extension houses the utility room to the ground floor. At basement level there are several large
rooms, unusually, two of which have a window between them.

The first floor of the property has four bedrooms, and some original shutters are still in place.
A further staircase rises from the first-floor landing to a second floor, which has bedrooms, a
box room and storage. Outside is a recently constructed garage.
As few of the original internal fitting remain in this property, it is considered that Westwood’s
Main attributes relate to its external appearance.
The property is situated within the Castletown Conservation Area, it may be considered that the
protection offered by Conservation Area legislation is sufficient to protect its handsome and
unique exterior. It could be argued that to place the property on the Register of Protected
Building would be an unnecessary burden upon the owners, when there is so little internally
worthy of consideration for preservation.
However, Westwood possess what is undoubtedly one of the finest facades of any property of
its period and type on the Island. There is also a strong possibility that it was designed by
Thomas Brine prior to his death in 1840.
This report contains no internal photographs of the property as we were refused permission to
take internal pictures.
Westwood, The Crofts, Castletown is considered worthy of addition to the Protected Buildings
Register by reason of the following:
Architectural Interest and / or Aesthetic Quality:
Particularly for the quality of the design of the facade of-the building.
Close Historical Association:
With the eminent, Manx Architect Thomas Brine.
Group Value:
Elderbank, Westwood and Crofton comprise and important architectural unity within the street
scene of this part of the Castletown Conservation Area.
