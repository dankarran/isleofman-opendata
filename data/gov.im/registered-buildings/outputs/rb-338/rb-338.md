Register Entry Summary – Ramsey Swing Bridge 
Details 
Name: Ramsey Swing Bridge 
Address: West Quay, Ramsey IM8 1DW 
Register Entry Number: 338 
Date of Registration: 28.2.2024 
History 
Prior to the 1890s, the only physical link across the Sulby River between the north and south areas of 
Ramsey was via the stone bridge on Bowring Road. Since its opening in the 1890s, the bridge has 
provided an important second link, giving access from West Quay to The Mooragh and northern 
harbour area whilst still enabling maritime access to the Shipyard and inner harbour. Standing just 
outside the Ramsey Conservation Area, the swing bridge represents a rare example of Victorian 
engineering, and helps to illustrate the town’s expansion during the 19th century. 
The bridge was constructed by Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington in 1892, 
having been commissioned by Ramsey Town Commissioners. The bridge was officially opened on 
29th June 1892; however there was no elaborate ceremony as there had been numerous disputes 
and complications during the construction period. 
The slewing ring was replaced in the 1970s, and various repairs to the metalwork were undertaken 
in the 1980s. An extensive refurbishment of the bridge was undertaken in 2013, which included 
replacement and realignment of the slewing mechanism and bearings. 
This registration includes the main swing bridge itself, together with the associated metal framed 
southern approach road from West Quay and the metal framed northern approach road up to its 
junction with Old River Road. 
MATERIALS: Painted steel structure with a central pier in dressed masonry. 
PLAN: Roadway and footway housed within steel structure. Central pier has small control/plant 
rooms either side of roadway (outside of trussed arches). Seaward side room is not evident on 
historic photographs. 
FORM: The bridge is formed of two steel trussed arches spanning 64 metres supporting the 
horizontal roadway deck. The structural panelling, gates and guardings of the approach roads from 
West Quay and Old River Road are formed of painted metalwork in the same style as the main 
bridge. The central pier on which the bridge rotates is constructed in dressed masonry.
