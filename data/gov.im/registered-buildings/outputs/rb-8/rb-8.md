Registry Entry Summary – Thatched House at Niarbyl Beach 
 
Details 
Name: Thatched House (formerly two Cottages), Niarbyl Beach 
Address: Niarbyl Road, Dalby IM5 3BS 
Register Entry Number: 8 
Date of Registration: 23.5.1983 
 
History 
The two beach side cottages at Niarbyl do not have a definitive build date. Background information 
provided by Manx National Heritage in support of a 2003 planning application suggests that the 
cottages are likely to date from the 18th century, although as vernacular building techniques and 
materials varied little over the course of numerous centuries, it is possible that the cottages date 
from the 17th century or the early 19th century. It is not certain whether the cottages are of the same 
age, or whether one pre-dates the other. The cottages are shown on the first edition ordnance 
survey map from the 1860s.  
 
Historically the beach at Niarbyl was used as the base for herring boats fishing the waters between 
Niarbyl and Peel, although the importance of Niarbyl for this purpose is thought to have declined 
rapidly from the 1850s onwards. The 1851 census listed five families (at Niable), three of which were 
headed by full time fishermen. By the time of the census in 1881, only one family was recorded as 
permanently living at Niarbyl. 
 
The Manx museum’s archive includes photographs and images from circa 1860s onwards, and these 
records appear to suggest that the cottages are largely unchanged from this period. 
 
Form and Materials 
The two cottages are single storey, with a thatched pitched roof. Both gables and the party wall have 
chimney stacks. The western cottage is open plan internally, while the eastern cottage has a single 
dividing wall to the right of the entrance door. Both cottages are three bays. Walls are constructed 
of Manx stone, with a lime wash finish. Doors and windows are painted timber. There is a single high 
level window in the north facing wall of the western cottage. 
 
The stone projecting pegs in the walls (bwoid suggane) – used to secure the roof thatching – are still 
in place, as are the projecting slates within the chimneys that serve to divert water away from the 
internal walls. 
 
Reasons for Registration
