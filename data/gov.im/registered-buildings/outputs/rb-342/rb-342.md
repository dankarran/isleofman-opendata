Register Entry Summary – Moore’s Bridge, Laxey
Details 
Name: Moore’s Bridge  
Address: New Road, Laxey 
Register Entry Number: 342 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025
History 
The bridge is named for its builder, John James Moore of Baljean Farm. While Moore’s family was 
from Great Meadow in Malew, he inherited Baljean Farm overlooking Laxey and is believed to have 
hired Irish labourers for the contract, housing them on his farm. 
The bridge was constructed as part of the highway works to build New Road, Laxey, which also 
included the bridge and embankment over the Laxey River immediately north of the Mine Washing 
Floors. Construction work started in 1852 and was completed in April 1854. A report in the Mona’s 
Herald dated 5th April 1854 states that New Road ‘was opened on Tuesday last by J. Haynes’ four-
horse coach North Star being the first to pass through.’ In 1961 the stone parapet walls were 
removed, the bridge deck widened with cantilevered concrete footways, and painted metal railings 
added to both sides. 
The bridge was one of the first on the island to be specifically constructed at a gradient suitable for 
coaches. The nearby Manx Electric Railway bridge, completed in 1898, mimicked the arch design of 
Moore’s Bridge. 
Details 
MATERIALS: Local Manx Group stone (commonly referred to as Manx Slate) with lime mortar 
pointing. Stone generally horizontally laid in a random pattern, with string courses and arch 
stonework also in local Manx Group stone. Widened bridge deck is formed of concrete planks laid 
across the bridge, cantilevered on both sides to accommodate footways. Painted metal railings 
provide guarding to bridge edge on both sides mounted on concrete upstands. Two lane roadway 
finished in tarmac with raised pavements both sides – precast concrete kerbs.  
FORM: Five arched two-carriageway bridge carrying New Road, Laxey, over the Glenroy River and 
valley. The arch closest to the northern end is not open, with a shallow recess in evidence within the 
arch. The stonework within this arch matches that of the rest of the bridge. Bridge piers have a string 
course from which the arches spring and a central pilaster. A further string course sits above the 
bridge arches, continuing around each pilaster. The underside of the cantilevered concrete footways 
are visible from Mill Road below. Painted metal railings provide guarding to footways, the initial 
stone parapet walls having been removed in 1961. 

Reasons for Registration 
Moore’s Bridge, Laxey, is entered into the Protected Buildings Register for the following reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST 
•
Named after its builder John James Moore, the bridge is one of the first examples on the Isle 
of Man to have been specifically constructed at a gradient suitable for coaches. As a stone-
constructed five-arched bridge, the structure is a nationally-important example of its type 
and retains much of its historic fabric, architectural form and craftsmanship including its 
round arches, string courses and pilasters.
•
The form and detailing of the bridge’s arches were used as the basis for the design of the 
adjacent Manx Electric Railway Viaduct, and as such the two structures have historic unity 
that provides a strong group value.
HISTORIC INTEREST 

Completed in 1854, the bridge is the largest structure built as part of the improvements to
New Road in Laxey, works which helped facilitate easier access to the village and helped
enable the village to be developed as a Victorian tourist destination. As such, the bridge
helps illustrate important aspects of the island’s social, economic and tourism history.
