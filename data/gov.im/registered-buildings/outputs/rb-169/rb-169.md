THE TOWN HALL and PUBLIC LIBRARY, DOUGLAS
HISTORIC BACKGROUND AND ASSESSMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ENTRY
ONTO THE PROTECTED BUILDINGS REGISTER
In 1896 the Municipal Borough of Douglas came into being having received the approval of
Tynwald the previous year under the Douglas Municipal Corporation Act.
During the 1600 - 1700's, Douglas had developed as the main centre for trade on the Island,
becoming almost a "boom town" and by 1800 had increased in size and was sustained by trade.
The nineteenth century saw the advent of sea bathing and the seaside holiday came into being.
Some areas of the old town were at that time quite unsavoury and unhealthy places, not to be
shown off with pride to the increasing numbers of visitors.
The old system of Town Captains had already been replaced by Town High Bailiffs, but even
this system was becoming increasingly difficult to administer.
A Town Bill was accepted in 1860 and following an election, on Tuesday 24th July, 1860, the
first Commissioners were elected: Samuel Harris, who had topped the poli, was elected
Chairman.
With the growth of the tourist industry, by 1891, 35% of the Manx population were living in
Douglas. The structure of the Town's government required to be reviewed and following
debate, the above-mentioned Act was adopted.
By 1900, in recognition of the new status of the town the Town
Hail and Public Library, built at a cost of £25,708.00., was in use.
A convenient site was reserved in Ridgeway Street which had been named after the Governor
of the day and the design was entrusted to MrArdron ER.1.B.A., of Messrs Ardron and

Dawson, Westminster.
The main building Contractor was Messrs Gradwell and Co. of Barrow in Furness. The style
adopted was "Renaissance" with the aim being to combine lasting strength with lightness and
elegance. Dressed rubble stone was used with Bath stone dressed openings.
The following description of the interior of the building is based on a feature in the Man's
Herald of March, 1900:
The principal entrance is in John Street leading to a spacious corridor, with floors
of marble Mosaic, containing the main staircase. On the left of the main corridor are
placed the Municipal Offices - The Town Clerk's Office, Enquiry Office, Public and
Rates Office and the Accountant's Office. To the right of the main corridor is the Water
Office and along the John Street side of the building are the Borough Surveyor's Offices -
Enquiry Office, Drawing Office, Building Inspector's Office and the Car and Sanitary
Inspector's Office.
Ascend the main staircase and we reach the floor on which the Council Chamber
and Committee Rooms are situated. The Chamber itself is a magnificent room, 47 feet by
32 feet, which has an arched roof with panelled ceiling. The floor is laid in Oak which
also used for the wainscotting and the Ardron mantlepiece. Overlooking the Chamber at
the Church Street end is the public gallery. A desk and chair is provided for each
Councillor arranged in a horse shoe style. A handsome bench is provided for the Mayor
and Alderman along the Ridgeway Street end. On the bench is also provision for the
Town Clerk, Borough Surveyor, Staff and representatives of the press. The furniture and
upholstery is in Morocco leather............ Adjoining the building in John Street provision
has been made for the town Fire Brigade. A large room houses the (horse drawn)
manually operated fire engine and appliances. There is also a tower for drying the hoses
plus a large assembly room for use of the men.
When plans for the new Municipal Buildings in Ridgeway Street were being considered it was

decided that this would also provide the ideal location for a new central library adjoining the
Town Hall. A date above the Library entrance suggests that its construction was commenced in
1897, two years before the foundation for the Town Hall were laid.
The requirement was for three main areas: Lending, Reference and Newspapers.
This aspect of
the building has remained substantially the same.
A feature of the Library was the section on Manx publications: this almost served as a
“national library" until the Manx Museum was opened in 1922.
With the advent of the Centenery of the Douglas Town Council, the major task of refurbishing
the Town Hall and Public Library was undertaken at not inconsiderable expense. The
programme of works included re-roofing; reinstatement of certain architectural features which
had gradually been altered, or disappeared; repair of original windows; repair and renewal of
stonework; the erection of a period Clock obtained from Potts of Leeds; a programme of hard
landscaping to enhance the setting of the building plus extensive works undertaken on the
interior of the building, including the refurbishment of the Council Chamber.
The main focus of Registration lies in the high quality external envelope in addition to the
major public spaces which are among the finest in the Island. During the life of the building,
alteration and reorganisation of some of the ancillary accommodation has taken place in
response to changing needs of the town's governing body: such ancillary spaces are not seen to
fall within the main focus of Registration, save from the aspect of maintaining the structural
integrity of the building as a whole.
The ultimate result is a building which still retains its most vital functional role whilst making,
what is acknowledged to be a major, and now enhanced, contribution to the Civic Architecture
of the Island's Capital.

The Douglas Town Hall and Public Library accordingly merits entry onto the Register of
Protected Buildings on the following grounds:-
1) The aesthetic quality of the buildings and
2) The unique role which the building has played in the
Sociological and Historical development of the Island's
Capital.
