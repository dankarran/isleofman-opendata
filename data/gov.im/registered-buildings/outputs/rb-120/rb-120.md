origin
description
Situated on north quay the structure consists of a cast iron pavilion
with glazed walls and a slate roof, The expression of the structural
frame is functional and the elaborate detailing of nonstructural panels
creates a human scale and an "atmosphere" appropriate to tourism.The
entrances are marked by decorated protruding canopies and the uppen
level of the roof is broken for a ventilation ridge chamber again
marked by an elaboration of ornament at the eaves and ridge.
The interior hag not been inspected.
There are no visual signs of structural deterioration although the
building appears neglected and it is understood that the roof’ leaks.
Many of the panels are in need of replacement although the present
use of ths building as an amusement arcade nesks any potential of
quality to the casual observer,
recommendation
It is suggested that there are no other comparable buildings of this
architectural type on the istand and that there is an architectural
quality of expression worth preserving. Although the present location
is not in the main stream of tourist or commercial activity it is
considered that over the longer term,north quay may once again assume
a significant role in the "structure" of Douglas. Because this building
hes not gained general acceptance as being worth protecting it is feit
that it will be vulnerable to redevelopment or decay if it is not listed.
