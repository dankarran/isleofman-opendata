description Douglas Railway Station, Bunk Hill Douglas
The somewhat rambling structure {as is required by its function)is
constructed of red brick with pitched slate roofs and a major glass
roofed "lean~tot entrance corridor, The profile of the brickwork has
been adapted to approximate to the platform roofing requirements in
a decorative fashion.Similarly the accommodation areas of the stution
have received some definition with brick pllasters and string courses
of geometrvicul rather than structural significance.
Because the building is sited in » hollow, there an imposing 5. boway
and cloch in a datached structure localed to be visible wiong Athol
Street.This structure with its tuin cupolas and central arch is well
cesolved but only related to the main station by 3

bo be a good exauple of such . Vietor ¢ a”
wT peopidéte to uc. dr & “monunent” bo the station in ihe %. of ites
possible ivion then it is reasoned that the clock/s vould suffice.
fowever there doce suad to be a considerable feeling of emotion on
the part of the general public dlrecte4 ward cotaining the stuvtion
intact regardless,and as public servants horities ~w55 take
such views into account.
