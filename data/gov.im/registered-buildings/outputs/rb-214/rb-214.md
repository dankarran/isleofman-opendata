ALBERT TOWER, RAMSEY
Ramsey’s outstanding landmark, the Albert Tower was “erected on Lhergy Frissell to
commemorate the visit to Ramsey of Prince Albert on the 20" September 1847. Queen
Victoria remained on the Royal Yacht in Ramsey Bay, whilst the Prince climbed to the
top of the hill. The tower is of slate and granite, 45 feet (13.7m) high and 16 feet (4.9m)
square.” (Kniveton p.12)
Built from mountain blue slate from the nearby Claughbane quarry, quoins and lintels of
South Barrule granite with granite corners, windows and coping, the tower marks the spot
where Prince Albert stood to admire the view over the town.
The tower was designed by a Manchester architect, George Watson Buck, C.E.A., who
also designed the Stockport Viaduct. A pioneer of railway engineering in England and a
colleague and friend of the famous George Stephenson, Mr Buck came to the Island to
retire in Ramsey. The tower was erected by two Ramsey builders at a cost of £300,
which was raised locally to commemorate the visit.
There is a plaque over the front door which features the three legs carved in relief, and is
still legible, although its condition is only fair. The carving by Mr T. Clague, the Ramsey
stonecutter whose handiwork adorns many Northside gravestones, reads:
ALBERT TOWER
Erected on the spot where H.R.H. Prince Albert stood to view Ramsey and its
neighbourhood, during the visit of her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria to Ramsey
Bay, the XXth September, MDCCCXLVIL.

“ ‘Royal Ramsey’ acquired its name, because, in the days before air travel, it was the
starting-point of three visits (in 1847, 1902 and 1920) by the reigning Sovereign of Great
Britain. The first visit, to Ramsey only, was that of Queen Victoria and the Prince
Consort on September 20, 1847. Although the Queen did not land in person, her
husband did so and apparently enjoyed the excursion. The visit gave rise to the printing
of the one and only issue of the “Ramsey Times” by Frears Leech, followed a few days
later by a broad sheet on the same subject.” (Radcliffe p. 68)
The Royal Squadron anchored in Ramsey Bay, flags were hoisted and guns were fired.
The High Bailiff, F. Tellet, Esq., embarked from the shore, bearing an address and was
joined on board by the Archdeacon. Many boats from the harbour surrounded the Royal
Yacht while hundreds of people lined the shores and crowded the pier. Prince Albert
landed on the beach below Ballure Glen, and accompanied by the Hon. Mr. Anson, the
Hon. Capt. Gordon and Capt. Crippin walked up through the beautiful winding glen to
the top of the hill, where the Prince was most taken with the splendid view that was
provided. As they ascended, they were joined by many distinguished persons from the
town, including Messrs. Quiggan and Cubbon. The Prince later continued along the pier.
It is reported that at nine o’clock that night, after the Prince had departed a party of
gentlemen, carrying requisite material, walked up to the point of the hill where the Prince
had stood and with the consent of the proprietor, a Mr Edward Stowell, Wm. Callister
Esq named the place in commemoration of the visit, “Albert Hill”, and the adjoining glen
“Victoria Glen”.
Following the Prince’s visit, a monument was called for in order to commemorate the
visit. Within a week, High Bailiff Telet presided over a meeting in the Court House
which decided to purchase a site and Mr Edward Stowell of Ballastowell — the Tower
Farm, made a gift of the land.
Easter Monday the following year, (1848), saw the laying of the foundation stone by Mrs
Eden, the wife of the Lord Bishop, Robert John Eden. The Reverend Kermode said a
oo“

prayer on top of the hill for the Queen and the Royal family. A parchment was read and
placed in a bottle which was sealed and placed under the foundation stone.
In June of that year it was reported that many visitors to Ramsey were climbing the hill
and taking away momentos of the partly constructed tower.
One year to the Prince’s visit it was almost complete and canons were fired from the hill.
The official opening was on the 24" July 1849, when between three and four thousand
people from all over the Island set out from the Market Place, two thousand of them
reportedly reaching the tower. The High Bailiff of Ramsey presented the key to Deemster
Drinkwater who unlocked the door and proceeded to the top of the tower, with the
Committee. Following the hoisting of a St. George’s flag bearing the Manx arms, a royal
salute was fired, the National Anthem was played and three cheers were given. To allow
anyone who desired to enter the tower free of charge, the Deemster donated to the
Committee a sum ‘equal to that which might be collected on the occasion.’
“The tower, much more accessible since the 1930’s when public footpaths were laid out
on the front of Lhergy Frissell, the hill on which it stands, has not been open to the public
since the Second World War, because of the state of the internal staircase.” (Radcliffe p.
70)
In the early part of the 1939-45 war, the tower was used as a look-out by the Home
Guard.
It has been suggested, that the Prince coming from Germany, where every hill has its
“Aussichturm” would comment on the need for such “outlook-tower” to view the
beautiful suroundings.
