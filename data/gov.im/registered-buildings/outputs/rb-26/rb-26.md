Reasons for Registration 
The former Social Security Office, Castletown, is included in the Protected Buildings Register for the 
following reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST:  
• 
The building’s external envelope is thought to date from the early 19th century, and includes 
its War Office identification stone. The property’s subterranean structure may include evidence or 
elements of a defensive outwork called the ‘New Worke’, part of the Castle’s defensive 
enhancements constructed during the 17th century.  
HISTORIC INTEREST:  
• 
Much of the building’s external envelope dates from the 19th century and from its use as a 
Military Library. The building also has a historic unity and historic functional relationship with the 
Castle and Castle Arms (Glue Pot), providing a Group Value illustrating important aspects of the 
nation’s military history.
