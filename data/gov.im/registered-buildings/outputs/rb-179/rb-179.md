Harold Tower
Harold Tower dates from 1833 - when the site was purchased for the purpose of constructing a house.
There appears to have been a folly on the site at the time. Work may not have started immediately, but
there was a requirement that the works should begin within three years and Sherwood’s map of 1949
shows the tower form as we know it today.
One or two early photographs of Douglas Head show the tower clearly, when it was a significant
landmark, but it soon became well screened by mature trees (some now protected by preservation
orders) as can be seen from photographs and painting in the Manx Museum archives. In these
images, only the top of the tower can be seen.
The name, Harold Tower, was used from the outset. {t would appear to be a reference to the Saxon
King Harold, but this needs to substantiated by more that the presence of the later plaque in his
honour, which his attached to the front elevation of the tower. Battle Abbey, built on the site a few
miles from Hastings where Harold fell in battle, was demolished in Henry VIIl’s purge on the wealthy
religious orders. The dedication to Harold, in grounds that had previously been part of a former
Nunnery Estate, may be a token gesture of recompense.
Harold Tower is well built, well maintained and striking in appearance and siting.
Reasons for placing Harold Tower on the Protected Buildings Register:
® itis a striking example of mid-nineteenth century confidence and sense of worth, as exemplified by
the rigorous but impractical form and the degree of decoration, in the form of castellation
® it is well built in Manx siate although there are few exceptional or important architectural features
(the windows are distinctive, the arched internal openings are characteristic of the period, the
chimney flues beside the entrance door are unusual).
e the plaster panels beside the front door are probably by a former resident artist (Colbald, who
rented the property for two years). They show Orry the Dane and Harold the Saxon, and are of
interest and merit.
e it has a significant and commanding site, even if now screened by trees (which must significantly
improve the micro-climate, even if reducing the views).
e ithas been altered and added to - but, on the whole, these changes have not damaged its integrity.
e its design is attributed to the notable Architect, John Welch.
® previous occupants include John Martin, painter of ‘The Plains of Heaven’.
Harold Tower is considered worthy of entry into the Protected Buildings Register on the following
grounds: -
1) the building’s architectural interest and aesthetic quality;
2) the building’s design is attributed to the noted architect John Welch
3) the building has had close associations with nationally, important people having been occupied
during the 1850's by John Martin: renowned 19" Century artist of “The plains of Heaven” and other
major works.
