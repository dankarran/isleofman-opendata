description etsuposcour
ts Mai
The building congiex.facussas upon the Octagonal chapél to the. gast
end of a series of stone buildings vurying fro. two to three storeys
in height.The chapel has fine pointed arch windows with stone mullions
and traccry and is capped by an octagonal pitehe. slate roof.The corners
cf both the chapel and the small rave which adjoins it on 2 cross axis
are all tuttressed to the eaves.
The main bouse is directly .ttached to the cl..pel and although built
of stone,there is a considerable variation in both technique and arch-
itectural expression throughout numerous additions and possibly alter-
ations. The facade to the main raod is eement rendered having a high
castelluted parapet whereas the rear treatment consists of exposed stone-
work of various courses with pitched slate roof and a varied assortment
of building shapes 4s part of a single complex form.
The buildings are set in a listincotly identifiable s.rden of pleusing
design and good maintenance.The buildings themselves are not in such
a good condition with the possible exception of the chapel itself.
recommendation
The building has extreme historical importance being foundea as the seat
of the official church on the island by Bishop Symon who died in 1247.
It is perhaps unfortunate that this long history is catalogued by so
many visual alterations to the original structure especially since so
many of them wre unresolved in terms of complimenting the chepel.Never—
theless the building in its setting should be listea Tor preservation
but in a manner does not prevent the buildings being returned to
a habitable condition.
