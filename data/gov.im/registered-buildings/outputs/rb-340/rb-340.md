Register Entry Summary – Legislative Buildings  
(Tynwald, House of Keys and Legislative Council Chambers) 
Details 
Name: Legislative Buildings (Tynwald, House of Keys and Legislative Council Chambers) 
Address: Buck’s Road, Douglas IM1 3PN 
Register Entry Number: 340 
Date of Registration: 2nd September 2025                    Date of Summary: 2nd September 2025
History and Details 
Note: For the avoidance of doubt, this registration includes the three historic legislative chambers 
together with their entrance lobby on Buck’s Road, as well as the former Bank of Mona Building 
known locally as the ‘wedding cake’. The modern additions above the chambers and along Finch 
Road are not included in the registration. 
Tynwald Chamber 
The present Tynwald Chamber was built between 1891 and 1894 to designs prepared by the 
architect Mr James Cowle, of Douglas. It was first used on 20th December 1894 and replaced the 
Chamber in Douglas Court House which had been used regularly since 1866 when legislative 
business was effectively transferred from Castle Rushen in Castletown. 
Externally the extension of the building is finished in Welsh facing brickwork and Bath Stone 
Fenestrations. The Buck’s Road elevation windows have leaded stained glass throughout, while the 
entrance double-doors are panelled timber with a semi-circular arched head. The principal façade is 
notable for its two asymmetrical oriel bow windows together with its ornate entrance featuring 
intricately carved consoles and a large segmental pediment with the armorial bearings of the Kings 
of Man at its head.
The adapted Bank of Mona building (commonly known as the ‘Wedding Cake’) is finished in white 
painted smooth render. Historically the building’s exterior has not always been white – archive 
images from 1920 show a clear contrast between the walls (understood to have been red) and the 
decorative elements in white. Windows feature a variety of decorative neo-classical 
embellishments including pediments, segmental pediments and consoles, while at ground floor the 
building’s distinctive cylindrical corner element features a colonnade with an entablature 
supported by seven columns with plinths to street level and intermediate dwarf walls forming the 
building line around the corner of the site, with ground level falling down towards Finch Road. 
Internally the Legislative Council sit at a raised bench with the Keys sitting in the well of the Court. 
The Chamber is timber panelled to picture rail height, with additional finely detailed panelling at 
high level featuring semi-circular arches and neo-classical pilasters. There is a decorative vaulted 
ceiling with a central rectangular stained-glass window. One side of the chamber features two arch-
headed stained glass windows with dressed stone fenestrations. 

The internal arrangement of the chambers has changed periodically. This has included the 
remodelling of the Legislative Council area into a horseshoe shape, reflecting the seating in its own 
Chamber, and the installation of an additional viewing gallery accessible by lift above the Legislative 
Council area. All of the chambers were rewired for the 21st century, enabling audio from all sittings 
and committee public oral hearings to be streamed live on the Tynwald website and for electronic 
voting to take place. 
 
House of Keys Chamber 
 
Former Venues 
 
The historic seat of the Manx Legislature and Executive was in Castletown. There the House of Keys 
met in Castle Rushen until 1706. In 1709 they moved to the Bishop Wilson Library, east of the Castle 
walls. This was used until 1818 when, due to its disrepair, the Keys retired to the George Inn which 
they termed "highly improper" for a body of "so much importance". 
 
A new building was subsequently erected on the old site of the Bishop Wilson Library building, 
completed in 1821. This was used until 1874, though from the 1860s the Keys had transferred most 
of their sittings to Douglas and met in the former Douglas Court House. The 1821 building has 
survived, Registered Building 29, and as of 2025 is a heritage attraction. 
 
Current Building 
 
In 1879 the Keys moved to the present building which was part of the premises of the Bank of Mona 
(originally designed by John Robinson in 1854-55) and was acquired from the liquidator of the Bank 
for £3,700. After some refurbishment, the first sitting in this Chamber took place on 2nd December 
1881. The House of Keys Chamber is situated in what was the main banking hall of the Bank of 
Mona, directly below the Legislative Council Chamber. 
 
The present Chamber has undergone many alterations. The seating arrangement that had been in 
use since 1932 was altered following the 2016 General Election to reflect the new twelve 
constituencies; however this change did not involve alteration of the physical fabric. 
 
The Chamber is timber panelled to picture rail height, with a timber panelled ceiling, timber pilasters 
along one side and six stained-glass windows featuring alternating representations of the three legs 
of man and the crest of arms. 
 
Legislative Council Chamber 
 
Former Venues 
 
The Legislative Council has its origins in the King of Man's Council of personal advisers. The Lord's 
Council, as it became, met in Castletown in that part of Castle Rushen which was adjacent to the 
present Court House. Major alterations to the Castle, particularly in the nineteenth century, now 
make its exact location uncertain. 

 
From the 1860s, Governors experienced various difficulties with their personal accommodation and 
the practice developed of the Council attending on the Governor at places convenient to his 
residence. Often this was in the Court House in Douglas, although various attempts were made by 
the Deemsters to re-establish Castletown as the permanent venue for the sittings.  
 
Current Building 
 
When the present building was acquired from the Bank of Mona in 1879, the Legislative Council was 
accommodated on the floor above the Keys Chamber. 
 
The Legislative Council Chamber has been remarkably little altered since it has been occupied by the 
Council. Among the framed photographs which hang in the Chamber are photographs of all past 
Presidents of the Legislative Council who have presided over the Council in the present Chamber. 
The Chamber is panelled in oak and the stained glass window in the north wall contains the Manx 
arms and the armorial bearings of the English Crown. 
 
The Council sit at a semi-circular table in the centre of which is the President's Chair, which was 
presented by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in celebration of the millennium of 
Tynwald. To the right and left of the President sit, respectively, the Lord Bishop of Sodor and Man 
and HM Attorney General for the Isle of Man. The remaining members are seated in order of 
seniority, the more recently elected members sitting furthest from the President. 
 
 

Reasons for Registration 
Legislative Buildings (including the Tynwald, House of Keys and Legislative Council Chambers) is 
entered into the Protected Buildings Register for the following reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST 
 
The three legislative chambers, together with their entrance on Buck’s Road and the former 
Bank of Mona building are nationally important examples of their building type with regard 
to their layout and form, and retain many elements of historic architectural fabric, 
decoration and craftsmanship including their internal decorative carpentry and their 
external decorative stonework and plasterwork. 
 
The three legislative chambers and their associated ancillary accommodation have a historic 
unity and historic functional relationship that provides a strong group value. 
HISTORIC INTEREST 
 
With the former Bank of Mona building dating from 1854-55, and the Tynwald Chamber 
dating from 1891-94, as the location of the island’s legislative debates and decisions for over 
125 years, the three historic legislative chambers illustrate important aspects of the Isle of 
Man’s democratic history as well as having close historical associations with many nationally 
important political figures.
