Ref:
A.P.069
Appeal by the Palace Group Limited under the
provisions of Section 7 of the Registered
Buildings (General) Regulations 1987 in respect
of Registered Building 116, The Palace Lido.
The material points made by the parties were
For the
Appellants
1.
It was accepted by the Department of Local Government and
the Environment that in the Notice dated 23 March 1990 the
registration of the building had been made solely on the
grounds of architectural interest. The reference in a
previous Notice dated 11 September 1989 to historic
interest was no longer part of the Department’s Case. It
was also agreed during the evidence of the Department that
the decision of the Planning Committee was not in
accordance with the advice given by the professional staff.
It was further given as evidence that the architectural
interest related solely to the interior of the building and
was not applicable to the exterior.
The submitted evidence and documents of the Consultant
Engineers and Architects, unchallenged by the Department of
Local Government and the Environment, left no doubt that
the possible cost of some £1.2 million needed to create a
sound waterproof and damp proof envelope to the appeal
premises would be prohibitive pro rata to the potential
income levels that could be generated. Restoration of the
internal features, presumably the nub of the registration,
was beyond practicality both in the financial sense and in
obtaining the necessary skills to carry out the works. Any
relevance of the building to the current social scene had
ceased and the funding of restorative works from revenue
was no longer possible. A dramatic fall in clientele and
revenue had brought about the cessation of the most recent
use and in spite of exhaustive enquiries and research no
viable alternative uses had been found for the building.
Many of the uses considered foundered on the
impracticability of the building and the absence of need on
the Island for a building of this size and nature. The
raison d’étre for the building had long gone and the
internal changes had removed all sense of quality.
The views of the Douglas Corporation in their letters of
the 30th August 1990 and the 1st November 1990 were very
important considerations since these reflected the views of
the local people on the matter of registration. After
examining the evidence and inspecting the building the
Corporation opposed registration. The Corporation concluded
that in the absence of any use that could generate funds
on the scale needed for the repairs and refurbishment and
bearing in mind that the purpose for which the building had

Ref:
A.P.069 Cont'd
been designed no longer existed considered that
registration was unjustified. The Corporation were well
aware of the facts concerning entertainment centres and
were able to make their judgment against the background of
their own ventures. The Corporation had also considered
the possibility of the building being split into small
areas of use but had rejected this as a solution because it
would destroy the primary characteristic of the building,
spaciousness.
It was invidious and inequitable that the Appellants’
should be required to incur exceptional costs to maintain a
building that had no prospect of becoming financially
viable and which has ceased to have any functional or
practical uses. No evidence whatsoever had been submitted
by the Department of Local Government and the Environment
to refute the Consultants’ conclusions on costs, revenues
and potential uses and equally no evidence had been adduced
to support the registration on the grounds of architectural
interest.
For the Department of Local Government and the Environment
There was no criteria available upon which the assessment
of architectural interest was made. In the case of the
appeal premises however it was considered that in terms of
social history, quality of decoration and ornamentation and
overall uniqueness registration was warranted, a
conclusion supported by the Manx Museum and National Trust.
The poor physical and decorative state of the building was
not disputed but nevertheless the building was of
architectural interest and worthy of restoration at any
cost. The evidence given on the alternative uses which had
been explored gave the impression that these investigations
had been of a superficial nature and it was believed that
there must exist somewhere a use that could be financially
viable.
Conclusions
The issue in this appeal is the conclusion of the
Department of Local Government and the Environment that the
appeal premises are of architectural interest and warrant
registration and it is my opinion that the onus of
justifying a registration on these grounds must therefore
rest with the Department. In my view the Department have
not provided the clear, conclusive and incontrovertible
evidence that I consider to be a basic requirement before
registration; with its implications for property owners,
can be shown to be justified.
Recommendation
Ts
That the appeal be allowed.

Building Registered at Planning Comnittee meeting on 30th August 1989.
Review requested by Kneale Callow on 27th September 1989 on behalf of
the Palace Hotel and Casino Ltd.
Site visit took place approximately in November between Palace
representations, their advocate and B Vannan and N Wilson of DOIGE when
implication of Registration was discussed.
During discussions it was apparent that the defined site of Registration
was incorrect and needed amending. ‘The red line on the location plan
included unnecessarily the following:
a. A flat roofed kitchen extension on the North East side of the
building.
b. Srall lean-to extension & the rear.
¢. he foyer area and building to the South-West which are later
additions and architecturally not very interesting.
Also during the discussions the Palace questioned the implication of
Registration as an alternative use would shortly have to be found for
the building and same considerable repair was necessary, internal and
external. In particular:
a. ‘The wooden dance floor is in a poor state.
b. ‘The ceiling required attention and painting.
¢. Several windows required attention and also maintenance and repair
and painting of the front facade of the Building. The Palace
indicated that under consideration was Sport and Leisure facilities
at ground floor level i.e. Squash Courts etc. upper area would
not form part of this proposal but was und jideration. ‘They
queried whether some small scale office facilities might
acceptable.
Palace were advised that any alterations would require the submission of
an application and care would have to be taken to preserve the fabric of
the building
etc and the dance floor.
