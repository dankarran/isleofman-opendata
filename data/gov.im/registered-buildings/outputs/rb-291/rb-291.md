## Extracted details
* Architects: Thomas Lightfoot
* Builders: Thomas Lightfoot
* Construction: 1877
* Reasons for registration:
  - The horse tramway has played an important part in the development of the Islandâ€™s tourist industry and development of Douglas as a resort during the C19th and Early C20th
  - The buildings are a unique survival due to their association with the horse tram and are of more than national historic interest due to being the last remaining in the British Isles.
  - The stables and terrace form an important group both architecturally and historically the significance of which is heightened by the survival of the group as a whole.
  - The stables and terrace form an important and unique example of a late C19th urban stable yard associated with a horse tramway, it is the last surviving horse tramway in the British Isles and possibly the world.
  - Their significance is also increased by the level of intactness of the buildings and surviving features.

Summary of Principal Building (s) 
A 19th Century  urban stable yard used for keeping horses used for the horse tramway and 
associated terrace which forms the faÃ§ade and cartway  opening to the stable yard.  
Reasons for Registration 
â€¢ HISTORIC INTEREST:
*The horse tramway has played an important part in the development of the Islandâ€™s tourist
industry and development of Douglas as a resort during the C19th and Early C20th
*The buildings are a unique survival due to their association with the horse tram and are of more
than national historic interest due to being the last remaining in the British Isles.
â€¢ GROUP VALUE:
*The stables and terrace form and important group both architecturally and historically the
significance of which is heighted by the survival of the group as a whole.
â€¢ Age and rarity:
*The stables and terrace form and important and unique example of a late C19th urban stable
yard associated with a horse tramway, it is the last surviving horse tramway in the British Isles and
possibly the world.
* Their significance is also increased by the level of intactness of the buildings and surviving
features.
History 
From the 1860s, development of the Douglas shoreline continued apace with the building of 
residences and boarding houses in and around the Castle Mona Estate.   
Around 1870, Thomas Lightfoot (1814-1893), an engineer who had been working on the 
Woodhead Tunnel near Sheffield, retired to the Island. In 1872, he was commissioned to build a 
horse tramway in Sheffield. On returning to the Island around 1875, he saw the opportunity to 
create a horse drawn tramway along the emerging Douglas promenades. The necessary legislation 
(Douglas Bay Tramway Act 1876) was read by Tynwald on 6th June 1876.  
The single-line Douglas Bay Tramway opened for business on the 7th August 1876. It ran from 
Summerhill (the foot of which was then Burnt Mill Hill) to Broadway / Iron Pier. The venture was 
so successful that the line was extended in January 1877 along what is now Harris Promenade and 
Loch Promenade.  
The site of the current Summerhill stables (formerly The Crescent or Tramway Terrace Stables) 
was bought by Lightfoot in 1877 from George Jones and his wife Margaret. It comprised cottage, 
stables, and outbuildings on The Crescent.  Lightfoot expanded the stabling facility with a new 
purpose built three-storey facility of stables with hay storage above. He also redeveloped the site 
of the cottage into a three storey three dwelling terrace on Tramway Terrace. 

Page 3 of 5 
Lightfootâ€™s was also responsible for initiating development of the Grand theatre, hotel and 
aquarium complex at the end of Victoria Street. In 1879, to raise additional funding for these 
ventures, he sold the horse trackway and buildings (but not the business) to William Dalrymple 
and John James Karran. The tramway operation itself was finally sold in 1882 and, from 1883, was 
owned and operated by the Isle Of Man Tramway [Company], Ltd. From 1883 onwards, additional 
land and buildings were acquired and erected adjacent to the Crescent site and on land across the 
road at the bottom of Summerhill â€“ the latter providing the first proper terminus station and 
tramcar shed. These were built in 1884, but demolished in 1896. Construction of a second line of 
track to form a double trackway from the Victoria Pier to the northern terminus was agreed in 
1888. While the tramway had the purpose of linking the centre of Douglas to the Derby Castle 
pleasure grounds, it was not until 1892 that a tramway extension was built between the foot of 
Summerhill and Derby Castle. In 1891 the company also bought No 1 Strathallan Crescent which 
became known as The Brig and which accommodated stables, tram storage and offices. The site is 
now Caineâ€™s garden. In 1894, the horse tramway was sold for Â£38,000 to the Douglas & Laxey 
Coast Electric Tramway Company which had opened an electric tramway service from Derby 
Castle to Groudle in 1893. In 1894 the electric tramway was extended to Laxey on the completion 
of the Groudle viaduct. Later the same year, the company was renamed The Isle of Man Tramways 
and Electric Power Company, Ltd to recognise the combined operations of the horse and electric 
tramways. In 1896 the company also opened the Upper Douglas Cable Tramway, which connected 
the southern promenade with the higher areas of Douglas. However, operation of all three 
tramways proved too demanding, and the company then leased the horse tramway operation to 
Douglas Corporation / Douglas Borough Council. 
The crash of Dumbells bank in 1900 resulted in the tramway company going into administration. 
The horse tramway and Upper Douglas Cable Tramway were subsequently bought for Â£50,000 by 
Douglas Corporation while the electric tramway was re-established under the newly formed Manx 
Electric Railway Co. Ltd. By the early 1900s the horse tramway had over 100 horses, and more 
than 900,000 passengers were carried each year. Additional land was acquired enabling the upper 
stables and blacksmiths to be built. 
In 1926 the last horse tramway in England closed at Morecambe, and the Douglas horse tram 
thereby became a unique British attraction. In 1936 the number of tramway horses reached a 
peak of 135 when 46 tramcars were in service. In 1938 the horse tramway carried 2,750,000 
passengers, the largest number ever recorded in a season. During World War II tramway 
operations were suspended totally, the horses were sold, and the tram lines became associated 
with the barbed wire boundary fences of the internment camps along the Promenades. 
During WWII the stables were requisitioned for use as a prison for internees under-going special 
punishment, with the individual stalls used as cells. 
In 1946, the horse tram service was resumed, though with fewer horses and tramcars. Despite 
greatly reduced passenger numbers since WWII, the horse tramway has continued to provide a 
seasonal operation to the present day. In January 2016, Douglas Corporation ceased operating the 
horse tramway and the service was taken over by the Isle of Man Heritage Railways division of the 
Department of Infrastructure, which also operates the Manx Electric Railway.
