REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: Saint Ninian’s Church
ADDRESS: Ballaquayle Road, Douglas
POST CODE: IM2 5DA
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GIRD REF: 379 771
History
St. Ninian’s Church was built in 1913 on Jand purchased by the trustees of the will of
Sir Henry Bloom Noble. The will of H.B. Noble contained instructions for the
erection of an Anglican church in or as close to Douglas as possible and he left
£10,000 for this purpose. At the time Douglas clergy objected to the choice of site
(then in Onchan) and the rearrangement of the Parishes that it caused.
St. Ninian’s was consecrated on 25" March 1914 by the Bishop of Sodor and Man
and dedicated to Saint Ninian of Solway.
The architect was a well-known church architect from London called William
Douglas Caroe (1857-1938) and the Church was built by Richard Costain and Sons of
Biundellsands and also Liverpool, a company that was founded in the Isle of Man in
1865.
Architectural Interest
Exterior
In substance the architectural style is Early English Gothic. The south elevation has
four single lancet windows and two, set as a pair at the west end. In between the
windows are buttresses, which rise to about 18” in height above eaves level. In the
south transept are two rectangular windows set in red sandstone with relieving arches
over. In the gable above are three small loop windows. On the west side of the
transept is a single storey projection with double entrance doors and a segmental arch
at the head, which connects to the vestry projection. The vestry has two rectangular
windows also in red sandstone. The southern elevation of the tower has two small
lights in the lantern above, in which are two equilateral arch window openings with
louvres, At the west quoin is a diminishing buttress extending up to the parapet with a
stair turret connecting into the eastern quoin. The return elevations of the tower have
the same features and style. The north elevation of the church is a repeat of the south
except for the transept, which has three lancet type windows, the middle one
extending into the gable. In the west elevation is a projecting entrance lobby with
heavy stone quoins. The recessed west wall has three small loop type windows. The
roof is single pitch with parapets. The west wall of the nave has three elongated
lancet style windows, the middle rising slightly higher than the other two. Either side
are windows to the aisles, which also have lancet style windows to both elevations,
which are set as pairs in red sandstone surrounds. The east elevation has four lancet

style windows with the middle two rising slightly above the others. In between the
middle windows is a diminishing buttress, which terminates at a point level with the
arch crowns. The outer walls of the Church are random rubble stone whilst the
internal faces are brick. There are pitched Westmoreland slate covered roofs to the
nave and the north and south aisles with box guttering where they meet.
Interior
The Church layout is on an east/west axis to a cruciform plan with north and south
aisles, transepts and a central tower.
The main entrance is through a porch adjoining the south transept. At the west end of
the nave is an inner lobby connected to an outer porch with north and south entrance
doors. Either side of the inner lobby are responds which rise to a four centre arch
which integrates the large west window. There is also a north porch but this is used
for storage. Between both aisles and the nave are four clustered columns on each side
with vaulting that springs from the capitals. In the north transept is a small side
chapel (St. Martins) with an oak reredos and retable behind the altar. At the east end
of the Church is the chancel with the altar standing on a predella within a small
porticus. The reredos is a particular feature and was installed in 1939 in celebration
of the Silver Jubilee. The chancel has a mosaic floor and the side chapel a black and
white marbled tiled floor. The choir stalls are situated in the north and south
crossings between the transepts. Behind the north choir stalls are large masonry
columns over which is part of the tower. The organ is located in a recess in the south
wall of the chancel.
The internal walls are unplastered random rubble with window surrounds and other
features in dressed sandstone.
A single bell was cast in 1912 by Mears and Stainbank of London.
Landmark Qualities
St. Ninian’s Church is a striking and recognisable landmark and the tower is visible
from miles around. It is located at a busy crossroads adjacent to the T.T. Course and
on a major road out of Douglas. It is a monument to the generosity of Henry Bloom
Noble and is a reminder of what he did for the town.
Group Value
The church does not immediately form part of a related group of buildings but it can
be associated with other developments connected to Henry Bloom Noble and his will
including Noble’s Hospital (now the Manx Museum) and the adjacent Noble’s Park.
Age and Rarity
St. Ninian’s Church is younger than most churches on the Island and its style is not
particularly rare.
Recommendation
St. Ninian’s is worthy of registration for its architectural merit, landmark qualities and
its association with Henry Bloom Noble.
