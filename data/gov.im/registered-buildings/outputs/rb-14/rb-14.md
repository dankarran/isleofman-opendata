Registry Entry Summary – St Runius Church 
Details 
Name: St Runius Church (former Marown Parish Church) 
Address: Garth Road, Crosby 
Register Entry Number: 14 
Date of Registration: 21.7.1983 
History 
Elements of church are believed to date from circa 1200 (parts of the eastern half). In the Manorial 
Rent Roll of 1511 the parish is named St Runii, believed to be a Columban missionary who came to 
the island in the 7th century AD. The church was extended westwards by approximately 5m between 
1750 and 1755, and a western gallery was added at or shortly after this date.  
The church served as Marown Parish Church until 1853, when the present Parish church on the main 
Douglas-Peel Road replaced it. The Chancel was by the 1840s in a dilapidated condition, and was 
taken down in 1849. The building was shortened and a new eastern wall constructed using the 
surplus stones. 
After the new Parish church came in to use, Old St Runius was used as a mortuary chapel, and a 
mission room where occasional services were held.  
Some repair works were undertaken in 1905 by Parish Clerk Thomas Lewin and his son Douglas. 
During these repairs, a portion of historic floor was revealed approximately two feet below the 
present floor. An old doorway and holy water basin (stoup) were also discovered at this time. 
The church yard is said to contain the graves of St Runii (or Runy), St Lomanus and St Onca, and is 
understood to have been larger historically than it now appears. 
The church is still used for services during the summer and festivals.
