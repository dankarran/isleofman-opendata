Dear Henry and Ruth,
Registration of Sulby Chapel Main Road Sulby Ramsey IM7 2HP
Due to a recent management exercise, comparing the paper records and the detail available
via the Department's website, it appears that no formal certificate of registration was raised to
confirm the Planning Committee’s endorsement of the entry of Sulby Methodist Chapel on the
Department's Protected Building Register at its meeting 24" April 1998,
Accordingly, please find enclosed for your records a certificate confirming such.
Should you have any queries as to the effect
of this registration please contact this office.
Yours sincerely
