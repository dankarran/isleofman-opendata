REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: The Whitehouse
ADDRESS: Main Road, Kirk Michael
POST CODE: IM6 2HH
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Michael Commissioners
GRID REF; 323 909
Introduction
The Whitehouse is a landmark building in Kirk Michael. The property dates from the eighteenth
century and has had subsequent additions. It is set back from ‘Main Road’ in extensive
farmland and historically it was one of the most important quarterland farms in Michael.
Notable owners of the Whitehouse include some of the most significant figures in Manx history,
such as the Taubman family, who were later of the Nunnery; Sir Miles Wilks, Napoleon’s gaoler
on St. Helena; Captain Quilliam of Trafalgar fame; Evan Gell, one of the Island’s leading farmers
and Joseph Mylchreest who became known as the ‘Diamond King’.
History
The present mansion dates from the eighteenth century, but the name ‘Whitehouse’ is found as
early as 1688 in the Diocesan Registers.
Notable residents of the Whitehouse include the Taubman family, who were later of the
Nunnery, Mark Wilks who was Napoleon's gaoler on St. Helena, Captain Quilliam of Trafalgar
fame, Evan Gell, a farmer who developed a shorthorn breed of cattle on the Island, and Joseph
Mylchreest, otherwise known as the ‘Diamond King’.
Mark Wilks (1760-1831)
Son of the Rev. James Wilks, Mark Wilks was born at the Vicarage in Kirk Michael and married
into the Taubman family.
He went to work in India as a young officer in 1782 for the East India Company. He rose
through the ranks and was a colonel at the time of the Mysore war of 1799; later he was the
Resident of Mysore state between 1805 and 1808. He wrote an account of the history of the
state, from the early days to the fall of the King Tippu Sultan during the Mysore war. He may
therefore be considered the first historian of modern Karnataka.

Mark Wilks must have retuned to the Isle of Man shortly after leaving Mysore as he was elected
a member of the House of Keys in 1810. However, his time in the Island was short-lived, as in
the spring of 1813 he was offered the post of Governor of St. Helena, which he remained until
1816. In 1815 Napoleon arrived at St. Helena following his defeat in the battle of Waterloo and
Mr Wilks was his gaoler until he left the post in 1816. Napoleon is said to have liked and
respected Wilks and had missed him after he left St. Helena (Moore A.W., 1901). Wilks
returned to the Isie of Man in 1816 and was again elected a member of the House of Keys. He
later became Speaker of the House of Keys, following the death of his father-in-law who had
previously held the position.
Captain John Quilliam 1771-1829
Captain John Quilliam served with Nelson as First Lieutenant on H.M.S, Victory at the battle of
Trafalgar in 1805. Foilowing the battle of Trafalgar, Quilliam must have returned to the Island
for a time, as he was elected a member of the House of Keys in 1807 and again in 1809. On
his retirement from the Royal Navy he lived at the Whitehouse and died there in 1829 (Cashin
T.L., 1999), although he is buried in Arbory churchyard.
Early nineteenth century
Directories from the early nineteenth century reveai that in 1823, a Mrs Margaret James was
living at the Whitehouse and in 1837 the resident had changed to Miss Louisa Cannell, who was
included under the section for ‘Gentry and Clergy’.
Evan Gell (1806-1887)
During the nineteenth century a Mr. Evan Gell purchased the Whitehouse. He was formerly a
wine and spirit merchant from Kirk Michael, but became a farmer when he moved into the
Whitehouse. He lived there for many years and was recorded as living there in directories from
1846 to 1883.
He was one of the Island’s leading farmers, particularly with regard to improving the breed of
cattle (Cashin T.L., 1999). He was Justice of the Peace, Captain of the Parish of Michael and
was elected a member of the House of Keys in 1844 and again in 1874. He was said to have
been a personai friend of Captain John Quilliam.
Evan Gell was having serious financial problems and he had no option other than to sell the
Whitehouse in a public auction in order to help pay his creditors. The property was purchased
by Joseph Myichreest for £9,500.
In Kirk Michael Parish Church there are two sidelights and a brass tablet in the chancel which
were erected in 1913 by the executors of the late Mrs Walker to the memory of thé Gell family
(Captain Gell, formerly of the Whitehouse).
Joseph Mylchreest 1839-1896

—~

Joseph Mylchreest, otherwise known as the ‘Diamond King’, made his fortunes in the diamond
mines of South Africa and returned to Peel, his hometown in 1888. After returning to the Island
to a heroes welcome, he became interested and involved in Manx affairs, becoming MHK for
Peel from 1891 to 1896. It is believed that he developed an interest in agriculture and this is
why he left Peel and moved to the Whitehouse. His main farming objective was to establish
pedigree cattle and sheep with a view to improving the stock of other farms on the Island
(Mylchreest B., 1993). He also used his wealth to buy other farms, including Kirby Farm, which
had 200 acres in Braddan, Kerrow-ny-Glough in Greeba, Lhergy Vreck in Kirk Michael and
Glenaspet in Patrick.
After purchasing the Whitehouse he set about transforming it into a magnificent Victorian Style
mansion, suitable for a man of his new found status.
The Diamond King is said to have become “a legend in his own lifetime” (Cashin T.L., 1999,
p.6) and the Whitehouse became a focal point of the village, with many social occasions being
held there.
Joseph Myichreest had six children and the Whitehouse was always a lively family home where
he and his wife Phoebe entertained a wide circle of friends from all walks of life. He was a
great benefactor to the people of Michael and had a keen interest in developing Peel as a
tourist resort, following the decline of the fishing and ship building industries at the end of the
nineteenth century. He died a comparatively young man on 28" December 1896 and he
remains one of the best remembered Manx personalities of the nineteenth century.
In Kirk Michael Parish Church the centre light, reredos and wainscoting in the chancel were
erected in 1898 to the memory of Joseph Myichreest, by his widow Phoebe
Architecture
The Whitehouse is a striking Manx farmhouse, originally dating from the eighteenth century,
with fater additions. The oldest part of the property is the main body of the house which can
be said is typical of the larger Manx farmhouses, with its rectangular shape with a pitched roof,
chimneystacks at either end, five windows across the first floor of the front elevation and the
front door positioned centrally underneath. However, a characteristic not typical of a traditional
Manx farmhouse is the projecting porch on the front elevation with the square bay above; a
feature which makes the property appear more elegant than other farmhouses. The front door
located in the porch is a Georgian style with side lights and a curved fan light above.
Substantial Victorian alterations and extensions were carried out for Joseph Myichreest during
the late nineteenth century. These additions however, have since been removed and the
property has regained its Georgian frontage, with modern extensions which are much less-
imposing.
Alterations by Joseph Myichreest
After purchasing the Whitehouse, Joseph Mylchreest set about transforming the Georgian
property into a magnificent Victorian style mansion with the addition of a four-storey tower, a

two-storey wing to the north, a conservatory to the south and castellated parapets to all the
property, except for the conservatory. All of the alterations for Joseph Mylchreest were
reportedly carried out by local tradesmen (Examiner, May 18° 1895), with the Kelly Brothers of
Kirk Michael responsible for much of the work. However, since then these additions have been
demolished and the house has been returned to its former Georgian style. The Victorian
alterations can still be seen in archive photographs.
Electricity was installed in the house, after only arriving in the Island five years earlier. Joseph
Myichreest also built a large dam reservoir in the hills above the house and water was fed down
from this to a water wheel and generator house. The electricity was stored in accumulators in a
large building, built specially for this purpose. He also installed a coke-burning stove for the
central heating of his large conservatory. In addition to this, he added a decorative wooden
staircase which became a central feature in the house. The staircase and much of the hand-
made furniture were crafted by the Kelly Brothers of Kirk Michael, who were also responsible for
much of the carved wooden interior of the parish church.
At the time Joseph Myichreest lived at the Whitehouse there was a large walled garden and
various farm buildings around the mansion house. These included stables, a coach house and a
farm manager's house, with the farm workers living in their own cottages in the village. The
stables had stalls where the carriage horses were kept and each of these had the horse’s name
on an engraved plate above (Mylchreest B., 1993). The cattle were supplied with water without
manual labour, with the water running into a trough in front of the cattle stalls. The steward of
the farm was a Mr Nivison and the business was run with such success that Joseph Mylchreest
reportedly said that “...he is immensely satisfied with the place and never has any wish to leave
it.” (Examiner, May 18" 1895).
The 1869 Ordnance Survey map shows that many of the Whitehouse outbuildings which have
survived today date from at least that time. They are arranged in a courtyard fashion to the
south of the main house and are hidden from view of Main Road by large mature trees.
The property today
Following the removal of the Victorian additions, the Whitehouse has now regained its former
Georgian style. The tower, the north wing, the conservatory and the castellated parapets have
all been removed. The two-storey north wing has been replaced with a single storey extension
and the conservatory to the south has been replaced with a lean-to extension. The parapet on
the old house has been reduced in height and where the porch projects from the front elevation
the parapet is pitched, emphasising this central feature.
The windows are Georgian style, similar to that in archive photographs of the property which
have revealed they were sliding sash with six panes over six. However, some of the modern
windows on the front elevation appear to be casements rather than sash windows and have
three panes over nine instead. The front door with its fanlight and sidelights appears to be
original. The property certainly seems to have retained many of its original Georgian features
when viewed from ‘Main Road’,
In front of the Whitehouse along ‘Main Road’, there is a low stone wall with a cast concrete
coping that has been replaced in recent years. Old photographs have shown that cast iron

railings once surmounted this wall, but these have now been removed. At its present low level,
the wall provides fine views across the fields to the Whitehouse and the hills beyond.
RECOMMENDATION
The Whitehouse is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for the following
reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
The Whitehouse is a striking Manx farmhouse dating from the eighteenth century. The
property was extensively altered during the Victorian era, with the addition of a tower and
castellated parapets, however these have since been removed and the property has been
returned to its Georgian style.
The property possesses many Georgian style features such as the windows on the front
elevation and the front door with its fanlight and sidelights.
To the south of the main house there are a series of outbuildings which are arranged in a
courtyard fashion. These appear to have survived from at least the time when the Ordnance
Survey Map of 1869 was surveyed, and although they are not visible from Main Road, further
investigation may be necessary if they are to be considered for inclusion on the Protected
Buildings Register along with the main house.
Historic Interest
The name ‘Whitehouse’ is found as early as 1688 in the Diocesan Registers and the quarterland
was one of the most important farms in the parish of Michael.
Close Historic Association
Notable owners of the Whitehouse include some of the most significant figures in Manx history,
such as the Taubman family, who were later of the Nunnery; Sir Miles Wilks, Napoleon’s gaoler
in St. Helena; Captain Quilliam of the Trafalgar; Evan Gell, one of the Island’s leading farmers
and Joseph Mylchreest who became known as the ‘Diamond King’.
Landmark Qualities
The Whitehouse is a well-known property in Kirk Michael. It stands alone as a prominent
feature in the landscape and the low stone wall along Main Road gives uninterrupted views
across the fields to the Whitehouse and the hills beyond.
