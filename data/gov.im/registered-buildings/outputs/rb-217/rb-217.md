ARCH TOWER HOUSE
SOUTH QUAY, DOUGLAS,
INTRODUCTION (7.0)
1.1
Arch Tower House was built as a private residence in 1853. The house is
built onto solid rock and it is situated adjacent to a cliff-face on the South
Quay where it is constantly damp. It is a cube-shaped, two storey stone-built
structure with a smaller off-centre tower at the back which has excellent views
of Douglas harbour. The walls contain random stones of varying shapes and
sizes, the window surrounds are brick and on the front elevation there are
limestone quoins. A main feature of the house and garden are the castellated
wall-tops which give the property an unusual appearance.
1.2
The property is currently empty and is being extended on the ground floor at
the front in order to enlarge the existing rooms. The present owner is Mr.
Roddy (662142) who bought Arch Tower House in 1998 after the suicide of
the previous owner. Following years of neglect, the property was found to be
in a very poor condition and Mr. Roddy is yet to move into the house, as there
is still much work to be done. He needs to know whether or not the property
will be Registered in order to carry out essential works, such as roof repairs
with or without the aid of a Grant.
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST (2.0)
2.1
At the front entrance of the property there is a large gate plus a high entrance
wall and pillars. A characteristic which is immediately apparent is the
castellated wall tops in the garden and on the house. An archive photograph
of Arch Tower House shows that in the intervening years various alterations
have been carried out and adjacent properties have been demolished. In the
photograph, the house was situated on the same level as the front garden but
since then the garden has been dug out and steps now lead up to the
property. These steps are located slightly to the right of the front door and Mr.
Roddy plans to move the steps so they are level with the entrance. To the
right hand side of the house there is a ‘secret garden’ situated in-between a
wall and the cliff-face. However we were unable to access this garden during
our visit due to the fact that it was overgrown. There is also a small back
garden, surrounded by a wall which is located up a series of stone steps from
the back of the house. There is a high entrance wail, pillars and a large gate
at front entrance.
2.2
A ground floor extension is currently being added onto the front of the
property. Prior to the construction of this extension the front wall was bulging
and unsafe and it does still appear to ‘dip’ in the middle. This is because the

left-hand corner at the front had become saturated, water was coming in and
the weight was pulling the wall away from the rest of the house, towards the
harbour. There are now structural steel ties extending the entire length of the
house from front to back which are holding the front wail in place. These are
clearly visible on the exterior of the property and on the first floor interior, but
there are plans to conceal these. Mr. Roddy had the option of knocking down
and rebuilding the front walt or building an extension which would stabilise the
bulging wall. It suited Mr Roddy better to build an extension because he
needed the extra room anyway. Inside the house the extension will make the
two downstairs front rooms (the living room and kitchen) much larger. In
order to complete these alterations, the lower part of the old front wall still
needs to be removed. The stones found on the new arch doorway previously
belonged to St. Mary’s Church in Port St. Mary; the door from the church will
also be placed here.
2.3
The main roof is in a very poor condition. Although none of the slates have
fallen off, the roof is leaking and the ceiling on the first floor is badly damaged
as a result. There is a flat lead roof on top of the tower and this is also
leaking, damaging the ceiling below. Mr. Roddy is reluctant to carry out any
of the internal repairs until the roof is fixed and for this he could use the help
of a Grant which Registration would provide. Externally the repairs involve
removing the pea-dash render and leaving the property bare stone with lime
pointing.
2.4
The original front entrance has panelling on the walls and ceiling which is
different in appearance to the panelling found in the rest of the house. The
old door looks identical to the door shown in the archive photograph of the
property. There is currently no back entrance, the former back door was
blocked up but it is planned to reopen this entrance which is located next to
the rock face. Access to the back of the house is from the front, alongside the
rock face and past the blocked up back door.
2.5
Inside the entrance hai] many floorboards are missing. Mr. Roddy does not
want to replace these until the major repairs such as the roof have been
completed. A noticeable feature here is the attractive spiral staircase which
features a spiral-shaped newel. There is a small corridor inside the entrance
which leads to the living room to the left and the kitchen to the right. These
are very small rooms which are now in the process of being extended.
Behind these rooms there are two even smaller rooms and in the room on the
right-hand-side the back door has been blocked up but there are plans to
unblock this entrance.
2.6
Throughout the property there is a high standard of detailing and many
original features have been retained. These features include the timber
sliding sash windows with the exception of the arched replacement on the
back of the house. There was formerly a very large rectangular window here

but the opening has been partially blocked up and replaced with a smalier,
arched window and this can be viewed best from the outside. Other
remaining features include doorframes, timber panelling, skirting boards,
cornices plus the two spiral staircases. Despite a large number of
characteristics still remaining in the property, all of the original fireplaces have
been removed or replaced.
2.7
The basement is found underneath the whoie of the house, with the exception
of the extension. A door hides the entrance to the basement which is via
small wooden steps which lead down from behind the main spiral staircase.
The basement consists of small rooms and there is a small coalbunker behind
a door in a wall. The owner was informed that there was once an
underground passage which led from the harbour to Arch Tower House which
hade been frequently used for smuggling, but we have found no evidence to
support this.
2.8
On the first floor there is a small bathroom to the left and a small toilet to the
right. At the front of the house there is a large bedroom which has three
windows on the front elevation. The ceiling in the main bedroom has been
extensively damaged by damp through the leaking roof and it will probably
need to be replaced. It is likely that this room was once two separate rooms
as it is much larger than the other rooms in the house and there is also a
blocked up doorway adjacent to the bedroom door which is now a cupboard.
This is recognisable as a doorway as the panelling is still visible inside the
cupboard, Inside the main room there are some interesting pieces of furniture
including a number of large chests and an old mirror with an unusual frame
featuring the three legs symbol, this is possibly a commissioned piece. The
structural steel ties are clearly visible inside this room and in the first floor
bathroom but Mr. Roddy plans to conceal these.
2.9
On the second floor there are two small bedrooms and again the ceilings are
in a very poor condition. The smaller of the two has a 1930's fireplace which
is soon to be replaced with a small Victorian style. The larger room has
panelling around the windows and doors which would have been too ornate
for a maid's room. There is also a box-room, perhaps a dressing room
attached to this bedroom.
2.10
A small staircase leads from the second floor up to the tower. The tower
contains a small box-shaped room with four walis which have timber
panelling, as does the ceiling. On each wail there is a window and from this
room there are excellent views of the harbour. The flat leaded roof above is
leaking and needs repair, it has caused the timber ceiling to rot and it will now
need to be replaced. A hole in the centre of the ceiling marks the position for
a flagpole. There is a small, Victorian, wrought iron spiral staircase which is
very ornate and this gives access to the roof. The wall tops of the tower are

castellated. There is some vegetation growing here and the flat leaded roof is
holding water which is damaging the ceiling below.
HISTORIC INTEREST AND ASSOCIATION (3.0)
3.1
Thomas Heywood of the Nunnery owned all of the land south of the river in
Douglas. Historically Arch Tower House was located on Archway Road,
South Quay and today it is the only property which has survived on that road.
There was a row of houses facing the bridge on the harbour which had an
archway through them, leading to a number of smail dwellings and onto the
Howe. “Demolished within recent memory and also known as The Arches, it
was opposite the Stone Bridge at the top of Douglas Harbour. It led from
South Quay to the Towers, and on to the Howside or Nunnery Howe. Also
known as Philip Quirk’s Archway after a local property owner, it included a
small court with six cottages.” (Slack S., 1996, p.16). Eccentric Frenchman
Pierre Baume resided in one of the properties on Archway Road. He was well
known as a miser and it has been said that he would lower down a tin on a
string for the locals to fill up with snails for his meals.
3.2
[t was reported in the Manx Sun on January 22TM 1853 that many properties
on the South Quay were to be sold at auction. These properties all belonged
to the estates of the late Mr. William Perrie and Mrs. Jane Perrie. One of
these properties was likely to have been Arch Tower House because it was
described as “...all and singular that newly erected CASTELLATED
BUILDING at the rear thereof, with the GARDEN thereto belonging, and lately
in the occupation of the late MRS. PERRIE.” (The Manx Sun, January 22"
1853, p.8).
3.3
On the 6" September 1947, Mrs. Margaret Ellen Taylor, widow, made a deed
confirming that she had been tenant of Arch Tower House between 1914 and
4941. A tenancy which she held from the Trustees of the Will of Miss Annie
Harris deceased. In this deed (copy attached ~ Braddan 1947 — no. 2236),
she asserts that throughout her tenancy, all the land marked pink on the deed
plan was taken to be part of the property, and was never contested at any
time.
LANDMARK QUALITIES (4.0)
4.1
Arch Tower House is located on an elevated position next to the cliff face on
the South Quay, Douglas. The property is visible from the North Quay and
the tower is a landmark feature of the inner harbour area.
os"

GROUP VALUE (5.0)
5.7
Following the demolition of Archway Road there are no longer any
neighbouring properties. There could be buildings on the South Quay which
also belonged to the estates of William and Jane Perrie but we have found to
information to suggest which properties these may be. Arch Tower House is
no part of an immediate group of similar properties but it is part of the history
of the South Quay.
AGE AND RARITY (6.0)
6.7
Arch Tower House was constructed in 1853 and at that time it was located up
Archway Road, upon which various other properties were found. The
property seems rather out of place today as these other houses were
demolished and have been replaced by businesses and a car park. An old
street lamp beside the gate to Arch Tower House is a little reminder of the
former streetscape.
CONCLUSION (7.0)
7.7
When considering including Arch Tower House on the Protected Buildings
Register, the following points should be considered:
® The building dates from 1853 and is therefore of a significant age.
e [tis part of the history of the South Quay.
e Many of the surrounding properties have been demolished, including
the archway over Archway Road which led up to the property. Arch
Tower House is precious because it has survived.
e The unusual style of the building, such as the castellated wall-tops and
tower.
e Many of the original features remain within the property.
e The property is located adjacent to the cliff-face on the South Quay and
itis a landmark feature of this area.
® The extension on the front of the property could have saved it from
future demolition but it does alter the character of the house.
