Reasons for Registration 
 
 
●ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST AND/OR AESTHETIC QUALITY:  
*The house is a good example of a Georgian neoclassic villa, the restrained use of architectural 
detailing is typically Manx which adds to its interest.  
*The house also retains internal joinery including staircase which are of good quality.  
*The use of a steel frame in the hall extension is early and innovative for the Island and 
contributes to the building’s architectural interest.    
●HISTORIC INTEREST:  
*A well preserved example of a Georgian villa and additions associated with Freemasonry.   
●CLOSE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION:  
*The house has been the home of 3 MHKs most notable being A.W. Moore.  
*The house was then bought and extended by the Freemasons for use as a masonic temple 
remains in that use. 
●Age and rarity:  
*The principle house is a surviving well preserved Georgian neoclassical villa of which there are 
very few examples upon the Island.  
*The Hall extension represents the only example of a purpose built masonic temple on the 
Island.  
History 
The Woodbourne Estate was established within the Ballaquayle Quarterland, in the Treen of 
Douglas, in the Parish of Onchan. The names of the road (Woodbourne Road) and the 
Conservation Area are both derived from the Woodbourne Estate and House.  
Thomas Harrison (died 1819, MHK 1801 to 1819) acquired the land in 1798 and the house was 
built between 1801 and 1818. He had purchased the land so that he could build a house closer 
to Douglas than his large house at Spring Valley. He named the estate Woodbourne (the 
stream in the wood), and this is the origin, with varying spellings, of Woodbourne Road, 
Woodbourn Square, Woodburn Terrace and Woodburn Place. 
The House was subsequently occupied by two successive MHK in the Harrison family Thomas 
Harrison Junior, (MHK 1819 to 1827) and Ridgway Harrison, MHK, MLC (1818 – 1894) . The 
house was then used as a girls school before becoming the home of the most notable Manx 
historian and Speaker of the House of Keys, AW Moore, for the twenty-three years until his 
death. The house was then bought by the Manx Masonic movement and has the only surviving 
purpose-built Masonic Temple built alongside.  
The contract for the erection of the new Masonic temple, to adjoin Woodbourne House, was 
issued in 1923 to Messrs Cowell and Corkill, Builders, successor to RF Douglas, to plans 
prepared by WH Lomas, who was the architect responsible for the Lancashire and Yorkshire 
Bank, Victoria Street. There is a detailed account of the construction, interior and the 
contractors given in the local press. It was to be a steel frame with Peel brick with cement 
facing, kitchens to go in the present substantial basement. The Banquet Hall was to have maple 
flooring. There was Grecian plaster decoration to the Temple and the gateposts were by the 
Glenfaba Brick Company. The main entrance to house was retained, and cost was not expected 
to exceed £10,000.  
Freemasons’ Hall was completed in 1924, with the Dedication Ceremony Dinner held on New 
Year’s Day 1925. The Foundation Stone of the Freemasons’ Hall had been laid on March 6th

1924 by Provincial Grand Master His Honour Deemster LaMothe ‘with ancient and stately 
ritual, corn, wine, oil and salt was spilt upon the stone – corn, typifying plenty; wine, gladness; 
oil, charity; and salt hospitality and friendship.’19 Four hundred Brethren of all ranks attended. 
The architect WH Lomas was referred to in 1924 as being a member of the firm WH Atkinson 
and Co. Elsewhere he is referred to as in sole practice, or in partnership (Lomas and Barratt). 
He died in 1933 aged 51. In addition to Freemasons’ Hall, he was architect for the Crescent 
Cinema, the Royalty Cinema, Martin’s Bank and Barclays Bank, Victoria Street, and for major 
alterations to several of the larger hotels, including the Peveril, Central, Villiers and Castle 
Mona Hotels. He had resided and practiced on the Island since 1920, and was a member of the 
Lord Raglan Masonic Lodge
