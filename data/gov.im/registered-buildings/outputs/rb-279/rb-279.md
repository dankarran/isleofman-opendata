REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: ‘The Level’ Gatehouse
ADDRESS: Croit-E-Caley, The Level, Colby
POST CODE: IM9 4AW
LOCAL AUTHORITY: — Rushen Parish Commissioners
GRID REF: 221 696
Introduction
‘The Douglas
to Port Erin railway opened to the public on the 1* August 1874,
one year
after the Douglas to Peel line opened.
Towards the end of the construction period, stringent economies were necessary to
allow completion of the line. This was particularly evident in the station buildings
constructed at the time, but itis also apparent in the gate keeper’s accommodation on
the level crossings. The Pee! line level crossings had stone lodges built from the start,
whereas on the Port Erin line small wooden huts had to suffice. Several of these were
later rebuilt in the form of the stone gatehouses we see on the Port Erin line today.
The role of the gate keeper is to protect the crossing; on the approach of the train he
opens the gates for the train and thus closes them to road users. A flag is then shown
to the locomotive driver to indicate it's safe to proceed. After the passage ofthe train
the gates are opened for road users.
History
Today's surviving gatehouses at Ballalona, Ballasalla, Mill Road, The Level, Ballagawne
and Four Roads provide a good cross sectional example of the different styles of
Gatehouses once seen throughout the Isle of Man Railway Co.'s lines, _Ballalona
(Santon) and Mill Road (Castletown) are good examples of the earliest form of
accommodation i.e. timber construction with corrugated iron roof, although the layout
of both these huts differs. Mill Road is believed to be the original hut at this location
and dates from the line's opening in 1874,
‘The stone gatehouses at The Level (Colby) and Four Roads (Port St.Mary) are almost
identical and relatively unaltered since built. Four similar structures also still exist on
the now closed line to Peel; Quarterbridge, Closemoore, Crosby and Ballacraine.
However these four are near derelict, although Closemoore, Crosby and Ballacraine do
still provide a very basic form of shelter on the ‘Steam Heritage Trail’.
‘The stone gatehouse at Ballasalla is similar to the ones at The Level and Four Roads,
‘however an extension was provided in 1962 by the Isle of Man Railway Co. to house a
‘ship’s wheel’ with which to operate the mechanical gates and observe the road.

The final example at Ballagawne (Port St.Mary) is again of stone construction, but was
extended by the Isle of Man Railway Company many years ago to provide living
accommodation for the keeper.
During 2003 the Castletown to Port St.Mary section of the Douglas to Port Erin line
was re-laid as part
of IRIS, the Island Sewage Project. Automation
of the road
crossings was part of this project and Colby Level was so treated with the electrical
control cabinets being mounted on the west wall. During this period the request stop
also received basic facilities for intending passengers; a short low-level tarmac
platform edged with brick, a bench and litter bin. Cosmetic additions also included a
station nameboard and a white painted wooden picket fence.
Currently Colby Level's building is in good order; the woodwork having been repainted
by volunteers of the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters’ Association in 2013.
As of the 2013 season only Ballastrang Crossing has manual gates and is permanently
manned; its staff member being provided with a basic moder hut. A bond currently
exists on this crossing preventing it from being automated; it is believed that steps are
being taken to try and lift this bond. When this bond Is eventually removed and the
crossing automated, another aspect of the Isle of Man Railway will pass into history
forever.
RECOMMENDATION
“The Level’ Gatehouse is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register
for the following reasons;
hitectural Int
* Pleasant stone built structure measuring 15’x10’ in plan, 8’ tall at eves and 10
6" at ridge, complete with red brick edging at the windows, door and lintels.
The roof is grey slate with simple wooden barge boards. One wooden door
and two pane window on the south elevation, four pane windows on the east
and west elevations; all with hardwood surrounds.
* A coal/wood burning fire is provided for the occupant.
Historic Interest
‘* Once Ballastrang is automated, the gatehouse at ‘The Level’ will become a
permanent reminder of how the railway used to operate i.e. a member of staff
spending many hours resident in the gatehouse, looking after and guarding the
crossing. The social history side of the railway should not be forgotten; this
building's role and its prominent location helps prevent that.
Age and Rarity
* One of only two stone gatehouses in original ‘as-built’ condition and in a good
state of repair.
* Colby Level’s Gatehouse is particularly worthy of registration as it also forms
the focal point for a ‘Request Stop’ on today’s Steam Railway
