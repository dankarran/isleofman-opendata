Registry Entry Summary – St Adamnan’s, Old Kirk Lonan 
 
Details 
Name: St Adamnan’s, Old Kirk Lonan 
Address: Ballamenagh Road, Baldrine, Garff (Lonan) 
Register Entry Number: 13 
Date of Registration: 21.7.1983 
 
History 
The site of Old Kirk Lonan is an ancient place of worship; the first keeill was built in the middle of the 
5th century AD and the nearby Holy Well is thought to have been a centre of pagan worship since 
pre-historic times. The chapel was originally known as ‘Keeill-ny-Traie’, translating as the chapel by 
the shore. In addition to the well providing running water, the site benefitted from being on the 
main pack horse road up the island’s east coast and being close to two good landing beaches. 
 
The site is the subject of the island’s earliest recorded law suit in 1188. Reginald King of Mann 
confirmed a grant of land called ‘Escadalla’, which included Keeill-ny-Traie, to the Prior of St Bees in 
Cumberland. It is thought that the western portion of the current building was rebuilt by the monks 
of St Bees following this ruling. 
 
Once the parish system was implemented in the late 13th century, Keeill-ny-Traie was dedicated to St 
Adamnan and became Lonan Parish Church. In 1733 parishioners petitioned Bishop Wilson 
requesting a new Parish Church in a more central location. The Act of Tynwald permitting the 
erection of the new church (All Saints’, Lonan) also ordered the destruction of St Adamnan’s. This 
order was not carried out, and the church fell in to disrepair. 
 
In 1895 the newly appointed Vicar of Lonan, Reverend John Quine, set about restoring the old 
church. Canon Quine is also credited with discovering the remains of the nearby well and cross. 
Much of the internal fabric in the eastern portion of the church (the roofed portion) dates from 
1895-1897.  
 
The church is still used for occasional services, and the grounds are the home of a small cross-house 
containing a collection of ancient crosses. 
 
Form and Materials 
The building has two distinct sections. The western and eastern sections are two separate buildings, 
with no bond between the walls until about 1m above ground. Both portions have a simple 
rectangular plan form, with no internal subdivision. 
 
The unroofed western section is thought to have elements dating from the 12th century. Walls are 
constructed of irregularly laid field and beach stone, with one section where cut stone has been 
used and laid in an alternating broad and narrow arrangement. The sandstone lintels are likely to 
have been sourced from the west of the island, or from St Bees. The blocked up doorway in the 
North wall may have been the entrance when the building’s floor was at a lower level. There is a 
small hole in the South wall adjacent to the arched opening known as the ‘Lepper Slant’, apparently 
used by beggars to see the Mass and have such alms as were given pushed through. 
 

The eastern portion of the building was restored by Canon John Quine between 1895 and 1897. The 
North window was re-opened during this restoration, and the method of construction is unusual as 
the arch has no keystone, being entirely composed of small stones on edge. The stained glass in this 
window was designed by the Canon and dates from the time of restoration. The stained glass 
chancel window also dates from this period, having been donated by Thomas and Anne Clague of 
Ballavarance Farm nearby. 
 
The restored eastern portion has a rendered western gable, including bellcote – otherwise the 
external walls are exposed stone. The roof is constructed of timber, trusses exposed internally, and 
finished in Cambrian slate. The entrance door is a painted timber double door.
