THE SCHOOL AND SCHOOL HOUSE
ST MARK’S MALEW
Nothing of the history of St Mark’s is recorded before the consecration of the church in
1772. In 1827 the Reverend John Thomas Clark was appointed chaplain of St Mark’s, he
found the church and parsonage in a terrible state of repair. Assisted by the great church
building Bishop William Ward, Clark set to work to improve the buildings.
By 1830 he had replaced the parsonage with a new building, in 1843 he instigated the
building of the school and the school house. The school carries a plaque which states the
year of erection to be 1843, but this may be the date that subscriptions opened as The
Manx Sun of 31 May 1845 carried an article announcing that on the 19 May a new school
house and a house for the master was commenced at St Mark’s
The same newspaper on 6 September 1845 announced that the new school was nearing
completion and was expected to open on 21 September . In 1847 the school had 88
children attending and 115 in the Sunday school. The schoolroom also housed the
circulating library which at that time contained 302 volumes.
The completed building was described by Bishop Ward as: “Sufficiently neat to be in the
suburbs of London”. It is built in Manx vernacular style, the materials used coming from
the immediate locality. St Mark’s is on the edge of the area where the extremely hard
granite was traditionally used in construction, particularly on features such as quoins and
weathering features. Several of the buildings in the hamlet contain granite, this includes
the church belfry, but the main body of the school and school house are built in random
stone rubble-filled walls, with a rendered finish. The walls have an overall thickness of 24
inches.

The front and rear porches designed by Armitage Rigby were added in 1902 are built in
coursed granite and incorporate damp proof courses unlike the original structure. The
bathroom extension to the house is built in cavity brickwork.
The roof is of pitched and gabled design and was reclad in Welsh slate approximately 10
years ago. When the roof cladding was replaced, new lead flashings and valleys were
provided. An internal inspection of the roof revealed that many new timbers have been
inserted and roofing felt has been used. The roof is of purlin and rafter construction, the
school house having two A- frames carrying the purlins between the gable walls.
The school house is at right angles to the schoolroom, resulting in two storey projections
on front and rear elevations. Sandstone kneelers are located at the base of the verges on
these projections and the verges have sandstone copings. Rigby replicated the kneelers on
the front porch in brickwork and provided a matching arch over the adjacent window.
Main windows to the schoolroom and the school house are sliding sash with some
smaller casement windows, whilst external doors may be original or of Rigby’s 1902
design.
Internally the floors, with the exception of the concrete in the porch extensions, are of
square edged timber boards supported on timber joists bedded into the main walls. The
school house retained what appeared to be its original internal doors and brass lever
latches until recent works. The building’s chimneys, like those of the nearby cottages,
also built by the Rev Clark, have an almost Moorish appearance: the same distinctive
style is reflected in the belfry to the church and is quite uncommon in the Island.

There is no record of who designed the original school and the master’s house but it is
reasonable to assume that Rev Clark played no small part in deciding its final form.
It is, however, recorded that in 1902 the architect Armitage Rigby (1860-1910) prepared
plans for the replacement of the small front porch with a more spacious design, the new
porch was intended to act as the boys’ cloakroom. His plans also provided a new rear
porch to give the girls a separate entrance and cloakroom. Both porches had stoves,
presumably to dry wet clothing, which until that time would have dried in the schoolroom
where the children where being taught. The porches unlike the main structure were built
in granite.
Rigby who was a contemporary of Baillie-Scott moved to the island between 1890 and
1895, after returning from studying in New York. He married into a Manx family and
lived on the island for several years contributing many fine buildings. He is recognised
as being one of the Island’s foremost architects who did much to develop and perfect the
use of the Arts and Crafts style of Architecture within the Island.
In 1917 the school ceased to be a church school and control was handed over to the Isle
of Man Board of Education. The building however was jointly owned by The Board and
the church, a situation that still existed until recently, when the church acquired the
Board’s interest.
In 1948 plans were submitted to provide the master’s house with a ground floor bathroom
extension. This extension was built in brick, and unlike Rigby’s adjacent rear porch does
not harmonise well with the original structure.
The school closed in the mid 1950s and since that time the schoolroom has been used
infrequently for church and social functions.

The school house has been unoccupied for several years, and it has not received the same
standard of maintenance as the schoolroom. Recently the interior of the house has been
stripped in anticipation of refurbishment. Internally in the schoolroom, a suspended.
ceiling has been installed and kitchen units fitted in the rear porch. It would appear that
the suspended ceiling replaced an earlier ceiling as the plasterwork only extends part way
up the walls above the suspended ceiling.
The school and school house is important as a body of evidence which details the
development of a parish and in particular the evolution of an educational building over a
period in excess of 150 years.
As an individual building it is important in its context as part of the ecclesiastical
grouping on the triangle which also contains Malew church (1772) and Church Cottages
(1846 & 1899).
It is considered worthy of Registration due to another important factor, this being the
building’s association with the Arts and Crafts Movement Architect, Armitage Rigby,
who designed the front and rear porches in 1902, and transformed the external appearance
of the building giving it its distinctive architectural style.
It is therefore recommend that the school and school house, St Mark’s, defined in
red on the attached plan, be placed on the Protected Building’s Register on the
following grounds:
1 Aesthetic quality and the building’s association with the acclaimed architect
Armitage Rigby.
2 The building’s high degree of external originality to external elevations.
3 Group importance with St Mark’s church and Church Cottages
