15 and 17 Riverside Cottages, Bridge Lane.
Number 17.
End elevation
A pait of small, semi-detached,
cottages facing a narrow alleyway
running off Bowring Road and down
to Bridge Lane, with additional back-
gate access to that lane. The right-
hand cottage, No.!7, has a slate-roof,
lean-to outshut on its gable end. They
are set noticeably /ow in the
landscape in relation to the
surrounding roads,
Externally they are very much in
original condition but quite well
maintained. Internally they are totally
different in both layout, condition and
appearance,
Rear elevation
Under a small glazed fanlight, a recessed front door, originally four panel solid, has had obscure glazed
panels introduced and leads into a long, widening hallway with a dog-leg stair running up the rear Lh. wall.

A small front living room with 1950s glazed tile fireplace and 12 pane timber sash window (without horns)
in deep, splayed, reveals, No shutters or other finings. 4 panel, rather thin doors with minimal plain
architraves and no skirtings. All the walls of the room have been dry-lined up to picture rail level (but not
above) with the lining being taken right across the chimney comers ~ see photo. This makes the room seem
even smaller. The ceiling is surprisingly high though. (c7’ 6”).

Front bedroom
The staircase has closed strings with
" turned scrolled handrail and plain square
balusters. There are two under-stairs
cupboards entered from the side
There is a fairly spacious square landing
with doors giving into the two
bedrooms. The front one has a tiled
fireplace, both have part sloping ceilings
and windows with curiously recessed
heads. Part of the ceiling in the back
The staircase is a return dog-leg with a half-landing over the back door (six
panel with inserted glazing) which gives access to a very small back-yard with
a gate (a present un-used) giving directly, up steps, onto Bridge Lane.
Rear Bedroom ceiling

The front bedroom has a 9 pane one-and-a-half sash window, without horns but the back one has a two-
light casement with small panes and the landing/stairs a full-size 12 pane sash.. They don’t seem to be in
too bad a condition and could certainly be restored (c/f No.15). Doors are 4 panel, thin section, presumably
original.
Number 15.
Once again a recessed front door under a rectangular glazed fanlight but this time in stripped pine with
Edwardian glazing bars and acid etched, bevetled-edge, glass, gives access to a short, narrow hall with the
stairs off at right-angles on the left. :
The living room has been recently dry-lined (as have all the walls in this house) and a replica “Victorian”
cast-iron grate with period tile inserts, has been installed and all doors, architraves and skirtings have been
renewed in varnished pine and the sash windows either renewed or cleverly restored, all with new brass
furniture.
: ’ Gne has to admire the window sashes which well illustrate just what CAN be done with
timber sash windows in that they completely conform to and match the earlier ones next door!

Living Room No.15 Riverside Cottages
Behind the staircase a modern kitchen has been installed across
the full width of the cottage with worktop hiding the chimney
breast but with shelves above in the chimney comers. Under the
stairs has been opened-up as a recess.
We have been informed that until the modern up-grading, the
layout of this cottage, and particularly the staircase, mimicked that of next door.

Fireplace wail of airs to left
Kitchen & back door
There is a narrow paved yard with a linear extension behind the yard of No. 17 to again give access via
steps up and a tall gate to Bridge Lane. Here again the access appears to have fallen out of use.
Upstairs the differences from next-door is once again most marked!
A quarter-landing at the top of the stairs gives direct access to two bedrooms but both have windowless en-
suite bathrooms.

The front bedroom has retained its chimney breast but in the back one and on the landing the chimney
breast depth has been used to form cunningly contrived shelved recesses which look like built-in bookcases
within the flush dry-lining. A trunked skylight has been formed over the stairhead.

External features - both cottages.
Generally stone built with walls about 2'3" thick, cement rendered and painted. Sash windows (except to the
outshut and some variation on the back of No.17) are moderately recessed and set above cement cills,
There is a prominent drip-stone above the back door of No.17
Roofs are of Welsh slate with plain eaves and verges. A chimney at each end with simple oversailing and 4
flues each. Some vestiges of slate flashings.
The property occupies a very tight site and thus the later single storey extension to No.17 has had to be
wedge-shaped and lies tucked-in below present road level. (As explained elsewhere, I am of the opinion
that the levels of both Bridge Lane and Bowring Road have be artificially raised since these cottages were
built.)
History.
Across Bowring Road from these cottages is the house (“Eskdale” ~ no.12 Bowring Road) reputed to be on
the site of the original farm-house of this branch of Ballachrink. This seems to have existed long before
Wood's Survey of around 1830, Constance Radcliffe has traced it back to 1711. It and the cottages are
clearly shown on the 1865 Ordnance Survey and the orientation and position of the cottages suggest a
building date before the construction of Bowring Road at the turn of the 18th. century. The level of the
cottages strongly suggest to me that they pre-date the construction of the bridge in 1755/6 which
presumably was concurrent with the embanking of the river and hence the building-up of the ground level
hereabouts.
If Bridge Road was the first road hereabouts, the track onto which the cottages front may have served as the
farm street leading from that road to the Ballachrink farmhouse on the site of "Eskdale". That the cottages
had so confined a curtilage would also be suited to their construction as farm labourer's dwellings in that
farm labourers would not be expected to need gardens or, indeed, have the free time to tend them!
There was, apparently, another cottage (or cottages?) immediately opposite their front doors as this area,
which now forms a small walled garden in separate ownership, still retains vestiges of a fireplace and
cupboard recesses. A cottage here was last occupied by a shoemaker and was demolished within living
memory.
From the research carried out by Lionel St. Quentin, it seems fairly positively that these two small semi-
detached cottages were built pre 1755 possibly by William Callow ancestor of Daniel Callow. They were
contemporaneous with a little cottage across the entry and with that segment of the Quarterland Farm of
Ballachrink whose building stood on the present site of “Eskdale”. There was not much else of North
Ramsey existing at that time — see Map 2 in my General History attached. In particular there was no bridge
. and no Bowring Road and the ground lay flat and open to the river and was probably prone to flooding at
the conjunction of Spring Tides and heavy rain or snow run-off from the hills down the Sulby River.
Distillation of the Electoral Role and discussion with Clifford Teare and the present occupiers, results in the
following:-

Brown’s Directory lists both 15 & 17 as being owned by D, C. Callow, rateable value £4-10-Od.each
Are this Callow and those listed above, all descendants of the original builder, one wonders?
Someone named Quine owned No. 17 early in the 20". Century when it was let to Brian Kelly,
By 1916 they were both owned by the Teare family (Butchers of Ramsey) and No. 15 remained in their
ownership until sold to Roger Cowin in the 1980’s who extensively altered it internally, He sold itto a Mrs
B. Walker who currently occupies it.
No 17 is owned and occupied by the Misses A.K. & LL. Clarke who inherited it from their mother and that
family have occupied it since at least 1945,
15 and 17 Bridge Road are well on the way to having the pedigree as being among the oldest properties
hereabouts.
