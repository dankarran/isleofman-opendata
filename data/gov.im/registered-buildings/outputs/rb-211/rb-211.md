BEACH COTTAGE,
BALLURE ROAD, RAMSEY.
INTRODUCTION (7.0)
1.19
Beach Cottage lies within Baliure quarterland, in the treen of Ballure, in the
Parish of Maughold. The other quarterlands which make up the treen of
Ballure include Ballastole, Ballacowle and Clenaige. Ballure is the only one of
these quarterland names which is still in use today, and the name Ballure
itself means ‘yew tree’ or ‘home of the yews’.
1.2
Ballure quarterland included the land which is now on both sides of Ballure
Road, the land in Ballure Glen and up to where the present reservoir now is,
plus the rough Lhergys south of the Glen. For many years the quarterland
was home to a Christian family, who were extremely influential in Ramsey. In
later years the Christians were to sell plots of their land for the Ramsey
Waterworks, the Manx Electric Railway, and for the extension of the town up
Ballure Road. ‘At no time can this have been prime agricultural land, but it
had advantages which served this Christian family well - proximity to Ramsey,
with the possibility of engaging in various forms of trade there; proximity to the
Ballure Burn which, in the early eighteenth century, enabled them to build a
water corn-mill on its banks...' (Radcliffe W. and C., 1979, p.242).
1.3
Beach Cottage belongs to a small group of houses situated between the
shore and Ballure Road which were almost certainly used as merchant's
homes, possibly dating from the eighteenth century, when access to Ramsey
would still have been limited before the harbour was built. Each building has
its own individual features but as a group they are remarkably similar with
their proximity to the shoreline and private routes down to the sea, which were
used for the trading.

1.4
Beach Cottage, Sea Cliff and East Cliff were merchants houses built upon the
cliff on Ballure quarterland, possibly pre-dating Ramsey harbour, when goods
were landed on the shore at Ballure and were then brought up the paths to
these cottages. Some of the oldest surviving buildings in Ramsey are without
a doubt on Ballure Road. East Cliff is thought to date from 1750, Sea Cliff is
thought to date back to 1720 but neither of these properties are proven to be
older than Beach Cottage which was referred to as early as 1700. ‘Soon after
1700, Marriad Kerruish, heiress of part of Ballure (Beach Cottage), married
John Christian, weaver, living on the part of Nicholson's quarterland which
became the bottom of College Street’. (Radcliffe C., 1986, p.130).
1.5
in 1703 it was recorded that Danold Corkill owned many houses along Ballure
Road. ‘The Danold or Daniel of 1703 also owned "houses on the hill", that is,
in Ballure Road; these were sold by his grandson James, a mariner in 1746
and 1747. The original property was inherited by Danold's sister Isabel (Mrs.
Christopher or Custal Johnson), from whom it passed to her nephew Martin
Corkill, glover, who perished on the coast of Scotiand in 1755, leaving an only
son William and several daughters. The son William had sold his inheritance
before he died in 1793." (Radcliffe C., 1986, p.122). The earliest reference to
Bailure Road was in a deed of 1764 when it was an established highway. As
William and Constance Radcliffe explain, 'Ballure Road (“the new highway on
Ballure Quarterland’) is first mentioned in a deed of 1764' (1979, p.339). Prior
to Ballure Road, the only access to these properties would have been along
the shore and up the cliff; this route was also used by residents of Ramsey on
their journeys to the ancient parish church of Maughold and Ballure Chapel.
1.6
Beach Cottage is not just one property but it is actuaily two houses which
have been converted together. From initially comparing archive photographs
and maps of Beach Cottage with the building today, we can see that many
alterations have been carried out, possibly during the time when the cottages
were converted into one. On the 1870 series Ordnance Survey map there
2

appears to be three adjoining cottages and a further building closer to the
shore, whilst today there are only two adjoining cottages and a garage.
However, to add confusion to the matter, the back of Beach Cottage which
faces the shore does not match the front, as there appears to be three, rather
than two separate buildings and there is also a different roofline. The taller
cottage, which is on the left hand side on Ballure Road, does not appear to
exist on the archive photographs but there is a smaller building instead,
similar to the present building but the same height as the adjoining cottage.
Obviously many alterations have been carried out on this property at some
point, possibly as the buildings were converted and some were demolished
and altered.
1.7
From the shore there are pathways up the cliffside to Beach Cottage, passing
an old lookout building or storage building, now being used partly as a shed.
There are three gateways from the back of the cottage which lead to two
routes down to the shore, one of these exits has been bricked up but it is still
clearly visible. This exit which has been blocked is in the portion of the wall
that juts out towards the sea, where a building existed on the 1870 series
Ordnance Survey map. The presence of these three exits indicates that at
one point there were possibly three separate cottages here, each with a
passage and route down to the shore.
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST (2.0)
2.1
Looking from Ballure Road, Beach Cottage consists of two properties
obviously not together, but which at some point have been converted
together. The right hand property is unusual in having some tile hanging on
the front elevation which has been painted, this is very striking and effective
as an early attempt to keep damp out. There are also tile sills on the windows
on the front and the house still has lead piping. Looking higher up, the
chimney has some stones sticking out and it has been extended, suggesting
that within there somewhere is an old Manx cottage. It has a very traditional
3

three-window elevation featuring Victorian sashes with no closing bars. The
front door and porch are interesting, they have decorative gables but look as
though they were done fairly recently, although there is a porch featured on
the 1870 series Ordnance Survey Map. The front gate has a rather nice
twisted gate pillar, but the railing tops look as though they may be newer. The
house next door (Grosvenor House dating from 1847) has the same gate
pillar as Beach Cottage, but with a far more original appearance to the
railings, suggesting that there has been some renewal here.
2.2
Looking from Baliure Road, the house on the left hand side appears to be the
property that was extended into and the position of the front gateway can still
be seen but there is no evidence of a front door. This is a taller house,
obviously later with wider windows but with sashes in the same design as the
smaller house. To the left of this is a smail garage with a slate roof, the
garage has a modem door but the whole composition is very nice. Also
worthy of a mention are the chimney pots, there is a mix and match of
chimneys which adds to the overall attractiveness of the property.
2.3
On the 1870 series Ordnance Survey map it looks as though Beach Cottage
is in fact three adjoining buildings, with a further building separate and closer
to the shore, however today there are only what appears to be two adjoining
buildings and a garage. By overlaying a current plan of Beach Cottage onto
the 1870 series Ordnance Survey Map, it appears that only the small cottage
on the right hand side along Ballure Road still exists. If these maps are
accurate then there seems to have been a considerable amount of demolition
and rebuilding at Beach Cottage, although it is not known when these
alterations were carried out. Therefore the taller building which is situated on
the left hand side facing Ballure Road is without doubt a complete or partial
rebuilding of the much older property, whilst the garage is a completely new
building.

2.4
There is a back wall on the sea cliff, on which there are three exits (although
one of these has been bricked up) and from these exits there are evidence of
two paths down to the shore, which are no longer all in use. These exits
suggest that at one point there were possibly at least three separate
properties here. The exit which has been bricked up is located in the part of
the wall which juts out to the sea, on the 1870 series Ordnance Survey map
there was a building here which perhaps was an out building used for storing
the goods for trade.
2.5
Situated on the sea cliff is a what looks like an old lookout building or a
storage building, which is now being used partly as a shed. This small
building was featured on the 1870 Ordnance Survey map and it was most
likely used as a lookout by the traders, due to its view of the sea which is not
obstructed in any way, the view from the cottage is poor as it is situated
further back from the shore, behind a high wail and trees.
2.6
Internally, Beach Cottage has some interesting features which would suggest
that a wealthy owner (perhaps a prosperous merchant) had invested a lot of
money in decorating the house. The most noteworthy feature is the small,
simple Georgian staircase which is probably eighteenth century; the staircase
has some very interesting newels and a tiny handrail. The walis of the smaller
cottage are very thick and some of these have been knocked through to join
the two properties and to give more space. The doorways and the ceiling are
notably low and these features, along with the thick cottage walls, suggest the
property is of a significant age and perhaps this smaller cottage is, or contains
the original Beach House of 1700.
HISTORIC INTEREST AND ASSOCIATION (3.0)
3.7
Beach Cottage was mentioned as early as 1700, in reference to the heiress of
this part of Ballure who was Marriad Kerruish (Radcliffe C., 1986). However,
5

looking at the 1870 series Ordnance Survey Maps it is clear that there were
three buildings where Beach cottage now stands and a further building was
located in between these three cottages and the shore, however this might
just have been an outbuilding. Therefore it is unclear whether one or all of
these buildings were actually Beach Cottage and if parts of the original house
from 1700 still remain.
3.2
itis almost certain that Beach Cottage was used as a merchant's home due to
the proximity of the shore, the pathway down to the sea and the lookout
building situated on the cliff. However, the origins of the building may have
been in farming, as a small cottage close by (Snowdrop Cottage) also shares
the characteristic route to the sea, although originally this was a farmhouse
and later Ballure inn (Radcliffe C., 1986). The routes to the shore would have
also been used for access to Ramsey and Maughold before Ballure Road was
built in 1764.
LANDMARK QUALITIES (4.0)
4.1
Beach Cottage is located on Ballure Road, which is the main road into
Ramsey from Laxey and Maughold, and which was also previously the main
route to and from Douglas. Despite the property being located on a main
road, it does not possess any noteworthy landmark qualities; it is more
significant for its group value with some of the surrounding properties.
GROUP VALUE (5.0)
5.7
Perhaps the most important characteristic of Beach Cottage is its association
with a number of other properties along Bailure Road, these former
merchant's houses situated on the ctiff have retained their distinctive routes to
the shore which were used by the traders. Each house possesses its own
individual features but as a group they are remarkably similar with their

proximity to the shore, paths to the sea and with their origins being around
1700-1750.
AGE AND RARITY (6.0)
6.1
Beach Cottage was referred to as early as 1700 and if parts of this original
building still remain, this would make it without a doubt one of the oldest
surviving buildings in Ramsey. Beach Cottage certainly pre-dates Ballure
Road, which was first mentioned in a deed of 1764. Up until the construction
of Ballure Road, access to Maughold, Ballure Chapel and Ballure Mill from
Ramsey, was along the beach and up the cliff at the present Fountains
Apartments, or along the shore and up through Ballure Glen.
CONCLUSION (7.0)
7.1
in summary Beach Cottage is part of a unique group of houses situated along
the cliffs at Ballure, which were almost certainly used as merchant's homes
and are still significant for their distinctive routes which connect the properties
with the shore. These houses are believed to date back to the early
eighteenth century and today they are some of the oldest surviving bulidings
in Ramsey.
7.2
Beach Cottage merits entry onto the Protected Buildings Register on account
of its age and its history as a merchant's home, this was a typical building
within the historical context of Ramsey in the eighteenth century, but very few
examples of these homes have survived, which makes Beach Cottage even
more significant. Perhaps most importantly, Beach Cottage should be noted
for its group value through its associations with some of the adjacent
properties, in particular East Cliff and Sea Cliff.
