CADRAN COTTAGE, BALLANARD ROAD, DOUGLAS
The present cottage is in fact a remodelling of an original traditional dwelling
which dates from pre-1869, being shown on the County Series of Ordinance
Survey Maps for that date.
Mr J W Ashburner of "Sunnyside", Victoria Road, the proprietor of the
Ballanard Brickworks, acquired the cottage and in 1910 commissioned the
services of local Architect Mr Kewley, to organise its refurbishment and
"modernisation" with a view to its being a weekend and summer retreat for
himself and his wife. According to reliable accounts, Mrs Ashburner did not like
the cottage and refused to go and stay there.
The property was let in 1914 to Mr and Mrs Hawley parents of the present owner
Mrs Ruth Goodyear; it has remained in this family since that time.
Mr Ashburner is known to have taken a keen interest in matters of design and set
up the "Sunnyside Workshops" for local craftsmen to practice and perfect their
skills. He worked closely with the Manx Artist/Designer Archibald Knox
(1864-1933) whose work drew on the revival of interest in the Island's history
and archaeology, in particular, it's Celtic traditions of art. Knox having traced
the wonderful spiralling tracery on the Celtic crosses, went on to explore these
forms weaving them into his own designs, especially in his metalwork. He went
on to achieve national and even international recognition largely through his work
for Liberty of London. We know that Archibald Knox was responsible for the
interior fittings (since removed) of a bedroom at Sunnyside, Mr Ashburners home
for his daughter and so it comes as no surprise to find that the remodelling of
Cadran Cottage bears many distinct hallmarks of Knox's design.
The project was probably carried out as a joint venture between Knox and Mr
Ashburner who are known to have worked closely on design projects. Knox
designed three different sundials for Mr Ashburner, two of which were exported
off the Island and the third, carved from a glacial boulder, was placed in the
garden of Cadran Cottage where it remains today: the inscriptions are at "noon"
and “traa dy liooar" diametrically opposed and are in the distinctive Knox style.
Internally the cottage has been remodelled with great skill to maximise the use of
space by creating purpose made built in furniture and storage units: of particular
note is the fitting around the lounge fireplace. This is a unique feature and
incorporates on one side a display cupboard with secret coal scuttle, central
mirror and overmantle and flanking the right hand side of the fireplace is a
longcase clock. A similar such clock by Knox (albeit somewhat altered) is now
to be found at the Murray Motorcycle Museum. A further interesting feature of
the two main reception rooms is a central air duct disguised as a beam,
incorporating circular outlet registers; these presently also incorporate light
fittings. The unique quality and charm of the architectural details and fittings
such as found in door and window furniture serve to make this a rather small but
very special building that is difficult to parallel on the Island.

The garden contains numerous items which originate from the Ballanard
Brickworks and the plan form of the garden remains substantially as it was in
1910. The treatment of the exterior of the cottage is somewhat "quirky": items
which were obviously salvaged from other buildings have been incorporated into
the design these include the use of cast window frames and at the main entrance
to the property we find a most striking cast iron gate which allegedly was one of a
pair and came from a property in the Falcon Cliff/Little Switzerland area. In
summary Cadran Cottage represents a unique expression of the arts and crafts
approach to design as particularly developed by international designer Archibald
Knox. It accordingly merits entry onto the protected buildings register on. the
following grounds:-
1. Aesthetic Quality
2. Uniqueness
3. It is the work of an internationally acclaimed designer Archibald Knox
