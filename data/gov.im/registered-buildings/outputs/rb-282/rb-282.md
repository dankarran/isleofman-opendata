History 
The Douglas to Port Erin railway 3 foot gauge line was opened to the public in 1874 and 
included a station at Port Erin. With the rise in the Islandâ€™s tourist industry the original stone 
station building was replaced in 1903. 
 
Constructed in red Ruabon brick in a romantic vernacular revival style the station shares a 
pallet of materials and some design details with its fellow branch line stations at Douglas and 
Port St Mary. The architect of the station has been suggested as being George Kay.  
 
Due to the success of the line and the station, alterations were made in 1914 including 
enlarging of the platform.  
 
The station has been in continuous use since construction with major renovation projects being 
undertaken in 1973 and 1990. The most recent works to the building in 2017 included the 
introduction of a canopy to the Station Road elevation and demolition of the former Road 
Services offices.
