description Ivydene,
The two storey detached residence has an articulated rectangular
plan form of masonry construction with red tiled interacting pitched
roofs which form a series of gables at the front of the house. The
ground floor is expressed by exposed cut stone while the second level
is half timbered and rendered in tudor stybe. The barge boards of
the various roof gables are heavily carved and the entire facade
treatment is of a well proportioned artistically contrived and
pleasing “rural town house".
Although no interior inspection has been made the residence is well
documented as an accepted work of art and in addition to such features
as the skylit gallery and copper hooded fireplace the interior is
described by James D.Kornwolf in his book on the architect and the
Arts & Craft Movement as being*...." finely designed and wrought stained
glass,hand—cut and hammered wrought iron hardware,repousse metalwork and
woodcarving".
The building is well sited in its own grounds and appears in good repair
recommendation
The house constitutes one of the better examples of the work of the
distinguished architect and demonstrates his fluency with the arts
and crafts style which he used for so much of his work on the island.
. It is recommended for listing in total for both:internal and external
features and the setting in it's grounds.Particular care should be
exercised in the control of any changes proposed for interior decor
and exterior windows or additions,

"Ivydene" - Little Switzerland, Douglas ~ 1893-94
Architect - Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott
This building is considered worthy of entry in the Protected Buildings
Register being one of the earliest recorded works of the internationally
renowned Architect Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Following a period of some three years spent in articles with Maj
Charles E Davis, City Architects of Bath, Baillie Scott accompanied by
his recent Bride, came to the Isle of Man on Honeymoon and during an
interview some years later with dohn Betjeman, Editor of the
Architectural Review, Scott recalled, "I went to the Isle of Man for a
holiday. I was so seasick I couldn't face the journey back, so I set up
practice there".
In the fullness of time Baillie Scott came to know Archibald Knox the
local born artist whose fame also spread beyond these shores. The two
were later to collaborate in the design and fabrication of architectural
features such as stained glass, copper repoussé fireplace hoods, iron
gates and such like, incorporated into some of Baillie Scotts houses in
the Isle of Man.
Baillie Scott was destined to become an Architect of international
vepute designing properties throughout England and as far afield as
Switzerland and Russia.
His works in the Isle of Man form a record of his early development: his
ote oe
sensitive and creative use of craftsmanship and materials together with a
quite revolutionary approach to internal planning and inter-relationship
of spaces not seen before in English circles.
Whilst on the Island Baillie Scott began submitting illustrated articles
to building magazines, which was to prove fortunate, as his office

records were later destroyed in two office fires.
Baillie Scott has long been recognised as an Architect of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Webb, Lethaby, Ashbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyens, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.
Accordingly, it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Buildings Register.
Built for R M Broadbent during 1893-94, Ivydene was, after the Mansion,
(Majestic Hotel) Baillie Scott's largest commission on the Island and,
was also one of the most successfully planned and executed houses.
The lower walls were built of Red Peel Sandstone and the upper walls were
half-timbered with ornately covered gables which echo the farmhouses of
Cheshire, so admired by Scott. This external horizontal division is
characteristic of Scott's early houses and also reflects into the
elevations the different functions of the upper and lower levels.
The semi-detached porch gives a sample of the materials used in the house
and also the craftsmanship which awaits inside in the form of finely
designed and wrought stained glass, hand-cut and hammered wrought iron
hardware, respoussé metalwork and Jacobean itnfluenced wood carvings
(Scott himself was not a craftsman and it would seem that the wood
carving was probably executed by Messrs Skinner and Clarke). Apparently
this area of Little Switzerland was owned at one time by the Kneen family
and Deemster Kneen in his conveyances of the property in the area
insisted on the buyer having his written approval of the elevations and
construction of the house to be built.

The low-ceilinged Hallway has folding timber panels enabling the Hall and
Dining Room to be combined for additional space where "the musical
evening" could be held. Drawing Room and Study have direct access, but
from a quiet zone. There is a fine staircase where the half landing
extends to form a room-like enclosure with a gallery overlooking the Hail
below.
The drawing room contains a copper hooded fireplace with respoussé
ornament and this is probably the earliest occurance of this feature
which was to become another Baillie Scott trademark: this is set in a
surround of blue and white Dutch tiling.
On the upper-level, the bedrooms open onto a wide sky lighted gallery and
the principal bedrooms take advantage of the attic space above having
polygonally vaulted ceilings laced with timberwork and embossed with tiny
roundels at the junctures.
The internal planning makes excellent use of the site which overlooks
Douglas Bay. The principal Bedrooms, Dining Room, Hall and Verandah are
all arranged on the seaward side of the site to take advantage of the
unobstructed view.
