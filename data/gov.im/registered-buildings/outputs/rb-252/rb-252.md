REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Spooyt Vane Old Sunday School and Mission Room
ADDRESS: Ballaleigh Road, Kirk Michael
POST CODE: IM6 1HH
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Michael Commissioners
GRID REF: 309 890
Introduction
Spooyt Vane Old Sunday School and Mission Room is a small single-storey stone
building, located in a quiet rural nook south of Kirk Michael. The hall was constructed
in the mid-nineteenth century as a schoo! house and it was later used as an Anglican
Mission Room, during which time it was said to be the smallest chapel in the Island.
The property is located near to Spooyt Vane House, the remains of an ancient keeil
and the waterfall, to which it owes its name. The name ‘Spooyt Vane’ means ‘White
Spout’, which is with regard to the appearance of the waterfall.
History
During the 1830's the well-known architect John Welch designed many churches and
chapels on the Island at the request of Bishop Ward. Of these buildings, three were
combined schools and chapels, namely St. Luke’s, Baldwin (1836); St. Stephen’s,
Sulby (1838) and St. James’s, Dalby (1839). Bishop Ward wished to bring places of
worship and educational centres for children to the inhabitants of remote rural areas,
who might otherwise have to walk many miles to the parish church or the nearest
village school. Spooyt Vane Old Sunday School and Mission Room is believed to date
from 1860 and like these other remote buildings, its original purpose was to provide a
school room for focal children in the area who might otherwise find it difficult travelling
miles into Kirk Michael village for their education.
The exact date of construction is not known, although it has been suggested on the
Manx Note Book website that the building was constructed in 1860, which seems to be
a likely date. The hall was certainly built by 1869 as it was included in the first
Ordnance Survey map which dates from that time, and the map referred to the
property as a “School”.
The hail is believed to have been constructed for Miss Gore Currie who was a niece of
the Bishop Powys (Quayle 1.R., 1927). Miss Gore Currie must have been related to
Bishop Powys through marriage, as in 1833 he married Miss Percy Gore Currie,
daughter of William Curry of East Horsley Park in Surrey.

Horatio Powys was Lord Bishop from 1854 until 1877 and like many other Bishop’s of
Sodor and Mann he had a keen interest in carrying out building improvements and
alterations. He was responsible for enlarging the chapel at Bishopscourt in addition to
various improvements to the property, including the construction of the west wing.
The cost of the construction of the school hall was £100 and the property was built at
the sole expense of Miss Gore Currie who personally managed the school there for
many years. At the time when Wood's Atlas of 1867 was surveyed, the land on which
the hall was built belonged to John Cannon and it was part of Ballanea quarterland, in
the treen of Bannister. In 1880 the land was said to have belonged to the Kelly family
(a Directory confirms they farmed Ballanea in 1881), who then sold the hall and the
surrounding land to the trustees for use as a school room (Manx Note Book website).
However, this would suggest that the property was not legally settled when it was first
built.
There is a tablet on the wall above the front porch which simply says 'SPOOYT VANE’
no date of construction is given, although archive photographs have revealed that the
tablet formerly said ‘SPOOYT VANE MISSION ROOM ENLARGED 1901’. The 1901
extension is a small brick built section at the rear of the building. The previous
existence of the date '1901’on the tablet could be an indication of when the building
began to be used as an Anglican Mission Room. During the period when the building
was used for religious purposes, it was said to be the smallest chapel in the Island
(Kniveton G.N., 1997).
‘It is not known when the building ceased to be used as an Anglican Mission Room,
although it is now disused and is privately owned.
Architecture
Spooyt Vane Old Sunday School and Mission Room is an attractive stone building set
in a quiet rural location on Ballaleigh Road in the parish of Michael. The exact location
of the property is at a road junction between Ballaleigh Road and a path which was an
old route leading to farmland to the south, along with Spooyt Vane waterfall, St.
Patrick’s keeil and priest's cell (which are now both ruins), just outside the boundary of
Glen Mooar. This path is privately owned and public access is granted by courtesy of
the landowner.
The hall is constructed with random rubble stone wails, including siates and beach
stones which are readily available from the nearby coast. The external walls are un-
rendered and they are an attractive feature of the local area. The roof is half-pitched
with natural slate tiles and there is a brick-built chimney stack with a single pot which
is centrally located in the north facing wail.
There is a small front porch on the western elevation, which is constructed of random
stone walls with a slate pitched roof. The porch almost certainly dates from when the
hall was first constructed as its formation matches the main body of the building and it
was also included on the Ordnance Survey Map of 1869. On the wall above the porch
there is a plaque which reads ‘SPOOYT VANE” The front door and gate are simple
designs in painted timber and they are likely to be original features. The lintels to the
door and windows are slate.

To the rear, or the east side of the property, there is a small brick-built extension
which dates from 1901. The extension is narrower and shorter than the main body of
the building and has a pitched slate roof to match.
The cast iron windows are a design which is seen on many churches and chapels
dating from the mid-nineteenth century, such as St. Luke’s Church in Baldwin (1836),
Quayle’s Hall in Ramsey (1837) and Welch House in Onchan (1842), Due to the fact
that the hall is believed to date from 1860, the mid-nineteenth century cast iron
windows therefore pre-date the building and they appear to have been taken from
another property and re-used in this hall, perhaps in order to save on construction
costs. The reason the windows appear to have been reused is because they were
originally longer in length with arched heads, but now they have been divided into two
shorter sections. The lower parts are located on the north elevation of the main
building and the upper parts with arched heads are located in the south elevation of
the main building and the brick built extension, dating from 1901.
The boundary walls to the site are constructed of random stones to match the building
and they are topped with a softer stone, possibly limestone. These walls are an
important feature of the property and they separate the hall, along with its small
garden area, from Ballaleigh Road. These boundary walls had been constructed by
the time the 1869 Ordnance Survey Map was surveyed, although the boundary to the
south (where there is not a boundary wall) appears to have been altered slightly since
that time.
The roof of the hail fell in 1999 and it was then replaced, saving the building from
severe damage. At the same time that the roof was replaced, the brick built
chimneystack was reduced in height and this was more than likely for safety reasons.
Other than these alterations, which were necessary in order to safeguard the future of
the building, the hall remains in its original condition.

RECOMMENDATION
Spooyt Vane Old Sunday School and Mission Room is suggested for inclusion on the
Protected Buildings Register for the following reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
The hall is an attractive stone-built property set in a quiet rural nook south of Kirk
Michael.
The building has a simple style which blends in well with the focal surroundings. The
un-rendered stone walls of the hall and the boundary walls are an attractive feature of
the area and compliment the natural slate roof. The cast iron windows are
characteristic of the mid-nineteenth century.
A brick-built extension was added to the rear of the property in 1901 and in 1999 the
main roof was replaced and the chimneystack was reduced in height. However, other
than these changes the hall has remained in its original condition.
Historic Interest
The hall was constructed as a school house in approximately 1860, in order to provide
teaching facilities for local children in the area who might otherwise find it difficult
travelling miles into Kirk Michael village for their education.
The building has also been used as an Anglican Mission Room and during this time it
was reputed to be the smailest chapel in the Island.
Close Historic Association
The hall was constructed for Miss Gore Currie, who paid the £100 building costs and
personally ran the school there for many years. She was a niece of Bishop Powys,
who was Lord Bishop of Sodor and Mann from 1854 until 1877.
