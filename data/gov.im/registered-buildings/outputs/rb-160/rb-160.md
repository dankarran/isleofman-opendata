recommendation
The house is significant as a good example of its style blending the
traditional British rural features with American influences. As the
house belonged to the architect it seems reasonuble to assume that the
design was not compromised in any significant nenner.
Tye total building and its setting(garden)should be protected

The Red House, Victoria Road, Douglas, 1892 - 93
This building is considered worthy of entry in the Protected Buildings
Register being one of the most important works of the internationally
renowned Architect Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Following a period of some three years in spent articles with Maj Charles
E Davis, City Architect of Bath, Baillie Scott accompanied by his recent
Bride, came to the Isle of Man on Honeymoon and during an interview some
years later with John Betjeman, Editor of the Architectural Review, Scott
recalled, "I went to the Isle of Man for a holiday. I was so seasick I
couldn't face the journey back, so I set up practice there".
In the fullness of time Baillie Scott came to know Archibald Knox the
local born artist whose fame also spread beyond these shores. The two
were later to collaborate in the design and fabrication of architectural
features such as stained glass, copper repoussé fireplace hoods, iron
gates and such like, incorporated into some of Baillie Scotts houses in
the Isle of Man.
Baillie Scott was destined to become an Architect of international repute
designing properties throughout England and as far afield as Switzerland
and Russia.
His works in the Isle of Man form a record of his early development: his
sensitive and creative use of craftsmanship and materials together with a
quite revolutionary approach to internal planning and inter-relationship
of spaces not seen before in English circles. x
Whilst on the Island Baillie Scott began submitting illustrated articles
to building magazines, which was to prove fortunate, as his office
records were later destroyed in two office fires.

Baillie Scott has long been recognised as an Architect
.of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Welds, Lethaby Ashbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyons, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.
Accordingly it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Buildings Register.
His first major project on the Isle of Man, The Red House was designed
and built by Baillie Scott during 1892-93 for occupation by himself and
his family - the foundation stone reads "This stone was laid by Mackay
Hugh Baillie Scott - aged 1 year 5 months October 20th 1892". At this
time the Architect himself was only three days short of his
twenty-seventh birthday.
The Red House is charming when viewed from any angle. Half-timbered
gables and barge boards were elaborately carved by local craftsman and
painted red, white and green. The Jacobean chimney provides a striking
feature in the external composition: internally chimney pieces and
fireplace inglenooks were to become an important element in the work of
Baillie Scott.
The Plan Form of the Red House is a most important feature of the design;
Scott uses circulation space ingenuously to provide a positive element in
his design, moving in the direction of converting the external walls into
space containers. Changes in level add interest and the main landings of
the house are large enough to be furnished and used as living spaces.
Entering by way of a small porch vestibule one enters the hall which
could also be used as a living room, from whence direct access to all the

rooms of the house can be afforded. The Red House illustrates Baillie
Scott's early development of living spaces opening into one another. The
vitality of the Hallway space is heightened by the introduction of
hinged, wooden panels between the Hall, Drawing Room and Dining Room and
are a most important inmovation at the Red House. This innovative
approach to planning represents a major contribution to the domestic
architecture of the period.
In Baillie Scott's words "These rooms are divided by panelled screens
which are removable and when taken from their position may be used as
folding screens in the various rooms. By this means the inconvenience
which arises from the inevitable smallness of rooms in a house where
economy is to be studied is obviated, and in a small house on festive
occasions a large amount of space can be obtained"
The quality of the spaces is enhanced by a heavy massing of the
fireplaces, the intimate inglenooks and open multi-roomed living areas
with graduated changes in level achieving a coherence of quite amazing
stature. The heavily carved timber in mediaeval style is carried through
into the interior in carved grotesques and friezes. Here for the first
time Baillie Scott also introduces the imported brickwork of the exterior
walls, internally.
Even the renowned Hermann Muthesius recorded, with the aid of
photographs, that "Here in the hall, one is struck by the almost total
transferal of the exterior architecture of the brick "walls and half
timbering. This creates a primitive mood that corresponds precisely with
the ideal of the inhabitant and the creator".
This is the only house which Baillie Scott built for himself, although he
renovated several old houses. Being Scott's first major work on the
Island, The Red House makes a most important contribution to the Island's

built heritage.
