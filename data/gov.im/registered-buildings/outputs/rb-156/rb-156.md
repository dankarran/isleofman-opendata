THE STRAND CINEMA
The Strand Cinema was the first purpose-built Cinema House in the Isle of
Man, opening on 26th July, 1913 and continuing in use for over seventy
years.
It is almost certainly the earliest and best example of a tiled facade
and as such, has undergone virtually no changes since its construction.
The building is a strikingly good example of "People's Palace"
Architecture and the composition makes a major contribution to the
streetscape.
The plan annexed to the Notice of Registration identifies that area of
the Cinema required to be retained to provide ongoing support to the
facade, which aspect of the building is the main focus of the
Registration.
