REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: Ridgeway House (formerly The Ridgeway Hotel)
ADDRESS: Ridgeway Street, Douglas, IM1 1EL
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Douglas Corporation
GRID REF: 381 754
History
In the early 1890’s following the demolition of an area of approximately six acres, bounded
by North Quay, to the rear of Duke Street, to the rear of Victoria Street and to the rear of
Ridgeway Street new parallel streets were laid out and plots of land were offered for sale to
developers.
On part of block C, on the corner of King Street and the then unnamed Ridgeway Street
(which was named under the then Lieutenant Governor, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway, but as
New Street on the original drawings) plans were submitted by Frank Laidman Heslop of
Athol Street, to Douglas Town Commissioners. The plans on behalf of W H Okell were
approved on the 14" December 1894, for the building of the Ridgeway Hotel. Heslop went
into partnership with Armitage Rigby in 1906.
The Ridgeway Hotel closed in 1996, and in April of that year plans were approved to convert
the building into offices, now known as Ridgeway House.
Architectural Interest
Exterior
The Ridgeway Hotel is constructed in a mixture of grey brick with red Ruabon brick
detailing, particularly around the windows. The roof is clad in slate with terracotta hip and
ridge tiles. The building is over four floors in addition to a former cellar which is now
basement parking.
The elevation facing Ridgeway Street has a large arch headed entrance doorway with
detailing in stucco, which extends upwards to include the first floor window. Above this
window is a stucco pediment and below the name of The Ridgeway in raised, rolling letters.
There is a large gable with brick columns and stucco scrolls. The top of the gable has a
pediment with the initials W H O, after whom the building was built.
The clevation fronting King Street reflects the same style and detailing as the front of the
building. This elevation has two smaller gable walls and a long dormer window.
At ground floor level the comer of the building has been chamfered. The overhanging corner
above has been accentuated by creating a projecting bay feature, which has been topped of
with a lead covered dome.
The original windows have been replaced with modern double glazed copies.

Interior
The interior of the building has been completely altered following its refurbishment to offices.
Landmark Qualities
Ridgeway House is a prominent corner building opposite the Registered Town Hall.
Group Value
Ridgeway House is very much an individual building but within a period terrace. (Although
the neighbouring property has been sympathetically restored after previous alterations). It
also sits opposite the Town Hall and former Public Library built at approximately the same
time.
Age and Rarity
The building is not particularly old but its style is unusual. The nearby Corner House Public
House and the Refuge Assurance Building reflect the same use of contrasting brickwork but
architecturally are quite different.
Recommendation
Ridgeway house has significant aesthetic quality, a high degree of originality and was
designed by architect Frank Laidman Heslop who later went into partnership with Armitage
Rigby.
For these reasons we recommend Ridgeway House be included on the list of Registered.
Buildings.
