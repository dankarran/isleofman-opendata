BALLURE COTTAGE,
BALLURE ROAD, RAMSEY.
INTRODUCTION (7.0)
19 . .
Ballure Cottage lies within Ballure quarterland, in the treen of Baliure, in the Parish of
Maughold. The other quarterlands which make up the treen of Ballure include Ballastole,
Ballacowle and Clenaige. Ballure is the only one of these quarteriand names which is still in
use today, and the name Bailure itself means ‘yew tree’ or ‘home of the yews’. The cottage is
included in the 1870 series Ordnance Survey Map (surveyed in the 1860's), but it is not
featured on the 1867 Wood's Atlas.
1.2
Baliure quarterland included the land which is now on both sides of Ballure Road, the land in
Ballure Glen and up to where the present reservoir now is, plus the rough Lhergys south of
the Gien. For many years the quarterland was home to a Christian family, who were
extremely influential in Ramsey. in later years the Christians were to sell plots of their land for
the Ramsey Waterworks, the Manx Electric Railway, and for the extension of the town up
Ballure Road. ‘At no time can this have been prime agricultural land, but it had advantages
which served this Christian family well - proximity to Ramsey, with the possibility of engaging
in various forms of trade there; proximity to the Ballure Burn which, in the early eighteenth
century, enabled them to build a water corn-mill on ifs banks..." (Radcliffe W. and C., 1979,
p.242). Ballure Cottage was not the original house of the Christians, but was built as the mill
house of their water corn-mill. ‘Baflure Cottage was once the mill house of the corn mill at
Ballure which was part of the Ballure Estate owned for many years by the Christian family.
Nearby was a church (which still stands), a mansion house and a farm.' (The Isle of Man
Daily Times, Tuesday, November 20th 1962). On the 1870 series O.S, Maps Ballure Cottage
is called Ballure House. Many of the surrounding buildings have long since gone, but two
smalt buildings featured on the map further up the glen could indicate the site of the corn mill,
due to their location on the river bank. It is doubtful whether Ballure Cottage was the mill itself
as there is no evidence of a waterway on the 1870 series Ordnance Survey maps and the
building is not like mills which were basic buildings, Ballure Cottage more resembies a
farmhouse.
1.3
John Edward Christian who lived at Baliure Cottage (recorded in the 1861 census) also
owned the majority of the Ballure quarterland. Therefore Ballure Cottage was a significant
residence during this time as it was the home of a wealthy landowner and has its roots as the
quarterland home and mill house of the Christians of Bailure.

1.4
It has been difficult to place an exact date of construction on the property due to the
conflicting dates stated by previous writers. For example, in an article in The Isle of Man
Daily Times, dated Tuesday, November 20th 1962, the property is described as being a
seventeenth century building and one of the oldest houses on the Isle of Man. The writer
states that 'The foundations and probably the thick walls of the cottage are almost certainly
17th century.’ (P.8). However William and Constance Radcliffe believe that the house was
built during the lifetime of Captain John Christian (1742-1823), ‘The present house, now
known as Ballure Cottage, was probably built in his time; some stones in the field behind it (by
the tramline) seem to indicate the site of the original house.’ (Radcliffe W. and C., 1979,
p.243). Certain features in the house such as the wooden panelling and the simple staircase
suggest the building is most likely to be seventeenth or early eighteenth century.
1.5
Ballure Road was constructed in 1764 and prior to this, natural features made access to
Ballure Cottage difficult both from the north and south. On the south, the main route to and
from the Parish Church of Maughold was sometimes extremely dangerous when the gorge of
Ballure Burn had to be crossed at a ford where the bridge and M.E.R. crossings now are. As
a safer alternative to this route, the townsfolk would make the journey along the beach when
the tide was out. Access to the mill from the town was from the top end of Maughold Street
(the main street), along the brooghs (gardens south of the Queen's Pier), following the
present lower Ballure Glen path up from the shore to the mill. ‘This was the path to Ballure
Mill which would be used by the Ramsey people who had corn to grind, Ballure Road (“the
new highway on Ballure Quarterland") is first mentioned in a deed of 1764.' (Radcliffe W. and
C., 1979, p.339).
1.6
The article on Ballure Cottage in The Isle of Man Daily Times (Tuesday November 20th 1962)
states that:
‘Ballure Cottage has one unique benefit. It is the only house in the Island known to
be exempt from water rates.
This is because in the late 19th century the newly formed private company, Ramsey
Waterworks Company, wished to construct a reservoir on the land above.
The Christians who owned the land and house (and who were to have their stream
dammed) made a condition of sale that the house should have a free water supply in
perpetuity.’
The reservoir was built in 1859 following a Water Act which fed to the formation of the
Ramsey Waterworks Company. This first reservoir was replaced by a larger reservoir in
1885, also in upper Ballure Glen. The original reservoir is no longer in use but it can still be
seen today.

ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST (2.0)
2.1
it is highly likely that the building dates back to the seventeenth century, certainly making
Bailure Cotiage one of the oldest houses in Ramsey, if not the isle of Man. The cottage has
been built in the traditional farmhouse style although it was the mill house of the water corn
mill, and it appears to have had relatively few alterations and additions over the years.
interesting features of the building include the very thick cottage walls, which are described in
The Isie of Man Daily Times (Tuesday November 20th 1962) as being ‘5-feet thick’.
22
Internally the property has remained littie changed, the most significant features are the pine
panelling, the crude staircase and the oak beamed ceilings, all of which appear to be either
seventeenth or early eighteenth century. The staircase becomes more and more simple on
each level of the cottage and it is almost barn-like in character on the top floor (second floor).
The Christians who built Ballure Cottage must have been extremely wealthy through land
ownership and the corn mill. However, despite this wealth, Ballure Cottage has remained
largely unchanged for centuries.
2.3
The cottage is set back from Ballure Road which it pre-dates (Ballure Road dates back to
1764), in a beautiful well-established garden admired for its large monkey-puzzle tree and
famed for having the largest fuschia tree in the Isle of Man. On the left hand side of the house
are the remains of another building, which could possibly be the adjoining building featured on
the early Ordnance Survey maps.
2.4
At the rear of the cottage there is an extension which includes a kitchen on the ground floor
and bedroom on the first floor. This extension was possibly already built by 1870 as there is
an addition featured on the back of the cottage in the Ordnance Survey Map from that year.
HISTORIC INTEREST AND ASSOCIATION (3.0)
3.7
Ballure Cottage was situated nearby the main routes south from Ramsey and the north to
Maughoid, Laxey and Douglas. The Oid Douglas Road is nearby, a pack-horse route which
leads to Douglas alongside upper Ballure Glen into the hills. Today this is no longer a road
but it is still in existence as a footpath. The Christians may have selected the best spot in
their quarterland for the cottage due to the access provided from the nearby routes, the
proximity to Ramsey, the shore and the river.
3.2
For centuries Ballure quarteriand was the home of the Christians ‘Ba/fure and the Flatt (part of
Ramsey) were the homes of other long-established numbers of the clan, which is said to have
had its beginnings in Milntown, Lezayre.' (Radcliffe C., 1980). The Christians were extremely

influential in Ramsey and contributed to the development of the town by selling building plots
of land along Ballure Road, and selling land for the Manx Electric Railway and Ballure
Reservoir. One of the best-known Christians was Captain John Christian (1742-1823), in
who's lifetime William and Constance Radcliffe believe Ballure Cottage was built.
3.3
One of the best-known residents of Ramsey, John Kennish (Jackie Hoodin or Jackie Ballure),
had connections with Ballure Cottage. “Old Pete’ was undoubtedly the most famous of
Ramsey characters, achieving a degree of national fame in the years after Hall Caine's The
Manxman appeared in 1894'. (Dearden S. and Hassell K., 1995, p.64). He became famous
after G.B. Cowen photographed him and his small one-roomed cottage, in order to illustrate
an American edition of the book. Old Pete was lame from early childhood, but despite this he
became a gardener and he later took to carpentry, making spinning wheels and knick-knacks
to sell to the many local visitors and carriage parties he entertained in the years after The
Manxman. Hall Caine featured both Ballure Cottage and Olid Pete in his book. 'Old Pete's’
tiny single roomed cottage ‘stood near the water trough on the right hand side going up the
hill from Ballure Bridge’ (Dearden S. and Hassell K., 1995, p.65). This small cottage was
probably 'Water Trough House’ which was featured in the 1881 Maughold Census; the
resident at the time was William Kennish, a 50-year-old mariner from Maughold. in the same
Census the sole resident of Ballure House (now Cottage) was John Kennish, a 44-year-old
gardener left in charge, from Maughold. John Kennish died on September 20th 1906, after
being ill with diabetes and his funeral was one of the best attended in the history of the town.
For many years after his death Postcards of ‘Pete’ and his cottage continued to be produced.
3.4
There is a house nearby called Ballure House (previously Ballure Cottage), which is situated
further down the glen next to the shore. It is probable that historically these two properties
had many close ties and may have been built for the same family. In her book ‘Shining By
The Sea’, Constance Radcliffe wrote that ‘One of the best-known private visitors to the Island
was Dorothy Wordsworth, who kept a journal during her tour in July, 1828. She and her
brother, the poet William Wordsworth, had come over to see his relations-in-law, Henry and
Joanna Hutchinson, Island residents, but Dorothy stayed in Ramsey on her own for a couple
of days with Mrs. Brew in Ballure Cottage in the Glen.’ (1989, p.17).
3.5
There is a nearby gothic-style Victorian house called Dunluce which was built in 1871 on part
of the quarterland of Ballure. The Abstract of Title of Dunluce records a deed dated 22nd
November 1920 in which Ballure Cottage (then Ballure House) was sold to the tenant William
Sherry, from the resident and owner of Dunluce, Amy Sarah Vondy. It seems that prior to this
sale, Baliure Cottage (formerly House), Dunluce and Bailure House (formerly Cottage, in the
glen), were all within the same estate of Ballure and in the same ownership. Ballure House
ons

(his cottage} was sold off in 1920 and Duniuce was later soid off from the owner of Ballure
House (in the glen) in 1960. An extract from the deed of 1920 follows:
‘All and singular a certain plot or parcel of land situate on the West Side of Ballure Road in the
said town of Ramsey and in the parish of Maughold part of the Estate of Ballure...to which
(inter alia) the vendor became entitled by deed of Sale dated the Twelfth day of November
One thousand nine hundred and twenty from John Edward Christian and wife.’
John Edward Christian was resident of Ballure Cottage In the 1861 Census but is not featured
in later years.
3.6
The deed of 1920 describes restrictions and conditions placed on the purchaser of the
property by the vendor. A description of these follows:
(a) ‘No Building or erection of any kind is to be placed or kept on any part of the
scheduled property except a motor garage for private use in connection with the
purchaser's adjoining property called “Ballure House” and nothing is to be stored on
the premises which shall be a nuisance or annoyance to any of the neighbouring
owners or occupiers of premises part of the Ballure Estate.’
(b) ‘The building of such Motor Garage shall be erected and finished in accordance with
a plan to be approved by the vendor her heirs or assigns.’
(c) 'The purchaser shall at his own expense forthwith erect and for ever maintain a good
and sufficient boundary fence between the scheduled property and the adjoining
property of the vendor.’
LANDMARK QUALITIES (4.0)
4.7
Although the property is of a substantial age, it is not a major landmark in the vicinity as it is
set back from the road and hidden from view by the large trees in the garden which dominate
the local scene. The property is more significant for its age, its preservation and its historical
association with the Christians of Ballure.
GROUP VALUE (5.0)
5.1
Bailure Cottage retains much of its original character and much of the surrounding landscape
has also been little changed since the mill-house days, such as Ballure Glen and the old
routes down through the glen to Ramsey and alongside the upper glen towards Douglas.
Perhaps the surviving building which the cottage had the most ties with is Ballure House
(previously Ballure Cottage) in the nearby glen.

AGE AND RARITY (6.0)
6.1
Dating back to either the seventeenth or the eighteenth century, Ballure Cottage is certainly
one of the oldest buildings in Ramsey, and possibly in the Isle of Man. Many buildings of a
similar age which still survive have been substantially altered over the years, and may now
contain features of various ages, but Ballure Cottage remains largely in its original form. The
pine panelling inside the cottage and the crude staircase many even be unique within the Isle
of Man. These unusual characteristics should certainly be included when Registration of the
property is considered.
CONCLUSION (7.0)
7.1
In summary, Bailure Cottage must surely be one of the oldest houses in Ramsey, if not, the
Isle of Man. It has important links with the history of the area through the water corn mill, the
Christian family and the development of Ramsey into Ballure quarterland. It is built in the
traditional farmhouse style and has remained little changed over the years, retaining much of
its unique character and history.
7.2
Ballure Cottage merits entry onto the Protected Buildings Register on the grounds of its old
age, and its historical associations with the quarterland of Ballure, the Christian family who
lived there for centuries, the water corn mill, plus 'Old Pete’ and Hall Caine's ‘The Manxman'.
Architectural features of Ballure Cottage also warrant the house worthy of Registration, such
as the unusual pine panelling, doors and the crude staircase, which have remained intact
throughout the house. If the cottage is to be Registered, then it is important for these
surviving internal features to aiso be protected as these significantly contribute to the unique
character of the house.
