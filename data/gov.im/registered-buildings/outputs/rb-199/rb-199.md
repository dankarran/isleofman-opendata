29 ATHOL STREET, DOUGLAS
Between the years of 1819 and 1821, Eleanor Lawrence and Jane
Hartley purchased a number of plots on the south side of Athol Street.
Eleanor Lawrence died in August 1824, and in her will appointed her
eldest daughter, Eleanor Weathereli (also spelt Ellinor on some
documents), as her Executrix and also the guardian of her youngest
daughter Elizabeth. Whilst Elizabeth was left a legacy of £25 British
per annum for life, Eleanor was left the remainder of her mother’s
estate. ‘
It is not clear whether by the time of Eleanor Lawrence’s death, 29
Athol Street had been constructed, but on the 14 January 1830 a
banker, James Holmes, purchased from Eleanor Weatherell and Jane
Hartley a number of properties including two houses on Athol Street
‘adjoining each other’. These were number 29 and 31 Athol Street
that had been built as a matching pair. In a transaction dated 234
January 1830, the same properties that had been sold to James
Holmes were resold to Eleanor Weatherell. It is, therefore, possible to
date 29 Athol Street to the period between 1821 and 1830.
In April 1844, Philip Elliott, a surgeon, purchased 29 Athol Street
from Eleanor Weatherell. Elliott was married to Eleanor Weatherell’s
daughter (also called Eleanor), and in 1845 a Trust was created that
made provision for the property to pass to their heirs.
Mr & Mrs Elliott died without leaving an heir, despite having three
sons all of whom pre-deceased them. The Trust provided for the
property to pass to Mrs Elliott’s elder brother Reverend Robert
Weatherell. He died without the conveyance of the Trust being
executed, and the property was inherited by his three sons: Robert
James; Edmund Percy and William Herbert Weatherell in 1883.
The Weatherell family sold the property to John Boyd in 1891, he in
turn selling to advocates Cyril Tomlinson Wynn Hughes-Games and
George Frederick Clucas in 1898. In 1901, Clucas purchased
Hughes-Games’ interest and held the property until 1921 when he
and his wife, Louisa Elizabeth Wynn Clucas, sold to another advocate
Henry Robert Gelling. Under Gelling’s Will, the property was inherited
by Patricia Kathleen Woodhouse Huddleston in 1961, who sold it to
Rea Brothers in 1976.
In 1999, Rea Brothers were taken over by Close Brothers Group PLC.
Today they occupy the property together with the adjacent number 31.
In the 1898 conveyance from Boyd to Hughes-Games and Clucas, the
property was referred to as a dwelling house with a named tenant. It
is therefore likely that following this transaction the property had a
change of use to an advocate’s office.

The property extends over five floors, comprising basement, ground
and three upper floors. It is believed the property is built in random
stone, although this cannot be verified due to the smooth cement
render finish applied, which is etched to simulate coursed stonework.
The roof cannot be seen from Athol Street, but the rear pitch is noted
to be slate, other than the extension which hasa flat roof.
It would appear that from the date of construction until the purchase
by Rea Brothers in 1976, the property remained largely unaltered. In
November of that year, they applied for approval for alterations to form
bank premises. These alterations included providing a new access
into the front ground floor room; removal of upper-floor partitions and
provision for five parking spaces to the rear. Following the purchase
by Rea Brothers of number 31 Athol Street in 1991, permission was
granted to create openings between the properties at ground floor and
each of the levels above.
In 1983, permission was granted to erect a rear extension to number
29. This has parking at ground floor level and offices on three floors
above. Access to the new offices was gained by replacing existing
window openings on the rear elevation with doorways. The extension
which has smooth rendered cavity walls and a flat roof is considered
out of sympathy with the original building.
There are railings at ground floor level that extend up the entrance
steps. A canopy which is unique on Athol Street covers the entrance
steps and extends over the neighbouring property, number 31. Both
properties have matching entrance doors with original fanlights above,
although the entrance to 31 Athol Street is now unused as access is
gained through number 29. The property was built in the late
Georgian period and has typical Georgian characteristics, being flat-
fronted and symmetrical; with a fanlight above the two-leaf front door
and a simple string course at first floor level. It retains Georgian~style
sliding sash windows, other than on the top floor where the windows
are top opening.
The property retains many original features, including the inner
hallway which has a very attractive pair of doors set in original
casings, with matching glazed framework above. In the ground floor
front office, there is a semi-circular archway that may well be original
as it is mirror imaged in the adjacent property. It is highly likely that
the staircase throughout the property dates from its construction, and
there is moulded cornice that also has the appearance of being
original. Various items of joinery including the non-functional
shutters and some doors to the ground and first floors appear to be
original. Other items of joinery including picture rails, architraves
and skirting boards may also be original but this cannot be verified.

There are several vertical structural cracks on the party wall with
number 31 Athol] Street. These are not new as they were referred to in
the 1979 plans submitted for approval.
Since the property was photographed for this appraisal, an air-
conditioning unit has been fitted through one of the windows on the
third floor of the front elevation.
Numbers 29 and 31 Athol Street were built as a matching pair, and on
the 1869 Ordnance Survey map they are shown as a single unit.
Number 29 Athol Street, together with its externally identical
neighbour make a significant contribution to the streetscape on Athol
Street, and is recommended for addition to the Register of Protected
Buildings on the following grounds:
1 Aesthetic quality
2 Uniqueness of design

31 ATHOL STREET, DOUGLAS
Between the years of 1819 and 1821, Eleanor Lawrence and Jane
Hartley purchased a number of plots on the south side of Athol Street.
Eleanor Lawrence died in August 1824, and in her will appointed her
eldest daughter, Eleanor Weatherell {also spelt Ellinor on some
documents), as her Executrix and also the guardian of her youngest
daughter Elizabeth. Whilst Elizabeth was left a legacy of £25 British
per annum for life, Eleanor was left the remainder of her mother’s
estate. It is not clear whether by the time of Eleanor Lawrence’s
death, 31 Athol Street had been constructed, but on the 14 January
1830 a banker, James Holmes, purchased from Eleanor Weatherell
and Jane Hartley a number of properties including two houses on
Athol Street ‘adjoining each other’. These were number 29 and 31
Athol Street that had been built as a matching pair. In a transaction
dated 23*4 January 1830, the same properties that had been sold to
James Holmes were resold to Eleanor Weatherell. It is, therefore,
possible to date 31 Athol Street to a period between 1821 and 1830.
In January 1835, Eleanor Weatherell settled the property on her
daughter Jane Weatherell, on the event of her marriage to John
Joseph Grier. The property remained in the family until 1920 when
Robert Grier, acting as trustee, conveyed the property to William Lay.
The Lay Family again sold it in 1949 to Alfred Howard Simcocks and
Stanley Allen, and Mr Simcocks purchased Mr Allen’s interest in
1952.
Mr Simcocks sold the property in 1987 to Bexhill Properties, who in
turn sold it to Rea Brothers in 1991. In 1999, Close Brothers Group
PLC purchased Rea Brothers and they are the current occupiers of the
property.
The property extends over five floors, comprising basement, ground
and three upper floors. The building has been refurbished over the
years to enable it to be used as office space rather than as a house,
the purpose for which it was originally constructed. However, these
alterations are mainly of a superficial nature and structurally the
property remains largely intact.
Rea Brothers occupied 29 Athol Street, and following their purchase of
31 in 1991 they applied for permission to create openings between the
properties at ground floor and each of the levels above. Alterations
took place to the rear adjoining Shaw’s Brow where a store was
converted to form a garage, and further improvements to the car park
area took place as recently as 1978.
It is believed that the property is built in random stone, although this
cannot be verified due to the smooth cement render finish applied,
which is etched to simulate coursed stonework.

The rear elevation is pebbledashed, other than the carport and
accommodation above which is in smooth cement render. The roof
cannot be seen from Athol Street, but the rear pitch is noted to be in
man-made asbestos slate.
There are railings at ground floor level that extend up the entrance
steps. A canopy which is unique on Athol Street covers the entrance
steps and extends over the neighbouring property, number 29. Both
properties have matching entrance doors with original fanlights above,
although the entrance to 31 Athol Street is now unused as access is
gained through number 29. The property was built in the late
Georgian period and has typical Georgian characteristics, being flat-
fronted and symmetrical; with a fanlight above the two-leaf front door
and a simple string course at first floor level. It retains Georgian-style
sliding sash windows, other than on the top floor where the windows
are top opening. There are modern replacement windows on the rear
elevation.
The property retains many original features, including the inner
hallway which has a very attractive pair of doors set in original
casings, with matching glazed framework above. In the ground floor
front office, there is a semi-circular arched recess that may well be
original as it is mirror imaged in the adjacent property. It is highly
likely that the staircase throughout the property dates from its
construction, and there is moulded cornice that also has the
appearance of being original. Most fireplaces have been removed,
although one remains which appears to date from the Victorian
period.
Numbers 29 and 31 Athol Street were built as a matching pair, and on
the 1869 Ordnance Sutvey map they are shown as a single unit.
Whilst no internal inspection of number 29 has been undertaken, it
does appear to have been extended and altered more than its
neighbour. However, it is difficult to justify considering number 31 in
isolation from number 29, which has an identical external front
elevation. It is therefore recommended that number 29 is also
researched for possible addition to the Register of Protected Buildings.
Number 31 Athol Street, together with its externally identical
neighbour make a significant contribution to the streetscape on Athol
Street, and is recommended for addition to the Register of Protected
Buildings on the following grounds:
1 Aesthetic quality
2 Uniqueness of design
