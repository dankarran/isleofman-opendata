"Thie Bannee", Falcon Cliff Terrace, Douglas - 1897-98
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott
This building is considered worthy of entry in the Protected Buildings
Register being one of a group of four terraced houses by the
internationally renowned Architect Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Following a period of some three years spent in articles with Maj Charles
E Davis, City Architect of Bath, Baillie Scott accompanied by his recent
Bride, came to the Isle of Man on Honeymoon and during an interview some
years later with John Betjeman, Editor of the Architectural Review, Scott
recalled, "I went to the Isle of Man on holiday. I was so seasick I
couldn't face the journey back, so I set up practice there".
In the fullness of time Baillie Scott came to know Archibald Knox the
local born artist whose fame also spread beyond these shores. The two
were later to collaborate in the design and fabrication of architectural
features such as stained glass, copper repoussé fireplace hoods, iron
gates and such like, incorporated into some of Baillie Scotts houses in
the Isle of Man.
Baillie Scott was destined to become an Architect of international repute
designing properties throughout England and as far afield as Switzerland
and Russia.
His works in the Isle of Man form a record of his early development: his
sensitive and creative use of craftsmanship and materials together with a
quite revolutionary approach to internal planning and inter-relationship
of spaces not seen before in English circles.
Whilst on the Island, Baillie Scott began submitting illustrated articles
to building magazines, which was to prove fortunate, as his office
records were later destroyed in two office fires.

Baillie Scott has long been recognised as an Architect of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Webb, Lethaby, Ashbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyens, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.
Accordingly, it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Buildings Register.
The design of this terrace of four town houses on Falcon Cliff Terrace
carries further Baillie Scotts simplicity of detail which fest manifested
itself in the pair of semi-detached houses, Myrtle Bank and Hollybank, on
Victoria Road.
The massive strength of these houses is best appreciated by setting thn
in the context of the cluttered panorama of late 19th century Douglas, It
there
is likely that the effect of these houses, with/revolutionary design,
will have been felt further afield than just within this Island. Baillie
Scott was apparently viewed as "revolutioniser of taste" by more who knew
him.
The houses are deceptively spacious and Scott's imaginative planning and
judicious use of every available space achieves maximum effect.
Baillie Scott trademarks appear again such as the Inglenook fireplace in
the Dining Hall and the interconnecting spaces which are a feature of
Scotts planning. The Dining Hall opens onto the main Living Room which
in turn opens onto the garden. The upper floors are light and airy
and a tall landing window on the front elevation, adds a feeling of
spaciousness to the stairway and the first floor areas.

Baillie Scott makes maximum use of minimum spaces and the terrace is seen
to represent an important landmark in the terraced housing, even outwith
the bounds of the Isle of Man.
The property has, some time ago, been converted into two flats with the
installation of an external staircase and with uPVC windows being
inserted since that time. However the present owners have retained many
original features and incorporated some internal alterations with due
regard to the architectural quality of the house.
