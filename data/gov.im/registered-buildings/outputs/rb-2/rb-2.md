Registry Entry Summary – Former Leodest Methodist Chapel 
 
Details 
Name: Former Leodest Methodist Chapel 
Address: Leodest Road, Andreas IM7 3EG 
Register Entry Number: 2 
Date of Registration: 23.5.1983 
 
History 
Leodest Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1835. The site was gifted by a local landowner, in 
the corner of a field called the Croit Ned on Leodest e Kee, a quarterland of Alia Leodest. 
 
The first seating was two blocks of box pews and some forms (benches), and was stated to have 
been for 166 people. The pulpit and ‘singing seats’ on either side were added at a later date. The 
building was intended to be used as a school, and to have a circulating library if funds permitted. 
 
The Manx Museum Archives contain an account book with entries from 1835 through to 1932, and a 
continuation from 1933 to 1949. A photograph dated 1st September 1965 showed the building in a 
disused state. 
 
Having been unoccupied for many years, between 2008 and 2013 the building’s external envelope 
was restored. A scheme to convert and extend the building for residential use received planning 
approval and registered building consent in March 2010. As of June 2023 the approved extension 
had not been constructed, with only the restoration and renovation works having been completed. 
 
Form and Materials 
A simple rectangular plan form approximately 11m by 7.7m. A single vertical panelled timber door 
on the east elevation, single timber sliding sash window on the north elevation, two timber sliding 
sash windows on the south elevation, a single timber sliding sash window together with a vertical 
panelled timber door on the west elevation. The door on the west elevation has been formed in a 
former window opening. The building has a hipped pitched roof with three roof lights on the west 
elevation and small chimney stack at the south west corner. 
 
The building is constructed of rubble stone, with a timber roof carcase. Following the renovation 
works completed in 2013, the building’s external walls are lime-washed, the roof is finished in 
natural slate (with modern ridge and hip tiles). The doors and windows are timber, the windows 
having an eight over eight glazing bar pattern and slate tile cills. 
 
Reasons for Registration 
Former Leodest Methodist Chapel is included in the Protected Buildings Register for the following 
reasons: 
ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST:  
• 
A surviving example of a mid-19th century Methodist Chapel in a rural location, constructed 
in local stone and retaining much of its historic external form, roof form and setting. 
HISTORIC INTEREST:  
• 
A surviving example of a mid-19th century Methodist Chapel in a rural location, illustrating 
important aspects of the religious and social history in the north of the island.
