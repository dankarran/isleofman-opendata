THE GOLDEN MEADOW MILL
ALEXANDRA ROAD, CASTLETOWN
The Golden Meadow Mill is an imposing limestone building located on arable
land just outside Castletown. It was one of the first Lord’s Mills, it was
previously the mill for the town and the earliest town mill on the island. It was
first recorded in the Manorial Roll of 1511-1515, in which it was referred to as
‘two grain mills near the Castle’; the tenant at the time was William Hubart.
The Mill is reported to have had a direct relationship with the Castle, as it is
reported that the mill leat (the downstream section of the mill race) runs into
the Castle, and the Castle is visible on a direct line from the two wheels.
“Probably the earliest Lord’s Mill stood here, though there are slight traces of
a tide mill in the basement of Castle Rushen — the place usually known as
Bishop Wilson's prison. The owners of the Castletown mills were usually
progressive and added other water-powered manufactures fo corn milling.
These certainly included flax scrutching and fulling and are reputed to have
included snuff and power grinding.” (Bawden T.A., Garrad L.S., Qualtrough
J.K. and Scatchard J.W., 1972, p.153).
The mill stands some way from the Silverburn and it was served by a leat and
a millpond. The source of the Silverburn is the slopes of South Barrule and it
reaches the sea at Castletown harbour. “it is one of the most important and
probably the first used sources of water power in Man.” (Bawden T.A., Garrad
L.S., Qualtrough J.K. and Scatchard J.W., 1972, p.185). Numerous mills
were located along the banks of the Silverburn, including the Meadow, Creg,
Abbey and the Grenaby Mills. The river was also known to have been used
for churning butter, grinding bark, powder, earch colours, polishing agents and
snuff, fulling, scotching, carding and cotton spinning, paper making and spade
production (Bawden T.A., Garrad L.S., Qualtrough J.K. and Scatchard J.W.,
1972, p.153).
There has been a mill on this site from at least as early as 1511 when it was
recorded in the Manorial Roll as ‘two grains mills near the Castle’. However it
has been difficult to establish a date of the buildings. D. Corlett’s report on
the mill in 1981 referred to an article in the Manx Advertiser dated February
29" 1816 which suggested that the buildings had only recently been built.
‘Those most eligibly and newly erected Com and Thrashing Mills at
Castletown to be let for a term of years, as may be agreed upon, and may be
entered upon at May or November next. Conveniently situated for carrying on
the whole-sale business and commanding the custom of a very extensive
neighbourhood....Apply at the Proprietor, Mr Thomas Moore, Great Meadow.’
The mill building was included on the first Ordnance Survey map of the area,
dating back to 1870 and the site was also featured on the Wood's Atlas of
1867 when Thomas Moore was the owner. The mill is a significant structure
built of local limestone, standing four storeys tall. Situated in the middle of
arable land it is visible from all vantage points around Castletown. Also
featured on the 1870 series Ordnance Survey map are the drying kiln in the
extension attached to the mill, and the adjacent threshing mill which has now

been converted into a residence. The mill at Castletown was unusual
because it had two water wheels side by side, one each for the mill and
threshing mill.
An important feature of the mill is the drying kiln located in the small extension
to the right hand side of the main building. Within this two-storey extension
there is a kiln located on the ground floor with a drying floor above.
The Golden Meadow Mill and the surrounding holiday accommodation are
currently owned by Mr. Cornelius J. O’Sullivan, of Leicestershire, England. In
his absence the properties are in the charge of Mr and Mrs Humphries who
live on the site. Mr. Humphries stated that the current owner bought the
properties around 16 years ago, however this is confusing as it does not
match the dates recorded on the deeds. The deeds recall a sale in 1982 from
Thomas Masson Moore to Longway Investments Ltd for £40,000, following
this the property was sold in 1997 to Cornelius James O'Sullivan, Denise
Carol O'Sullivan and Jaclyn Lorraine O’Sullivan for £293,852. During our visit
on Wednesday 28" August 2002, Mr Humphries was able to highlight many of
the changes which have taken place over the last 16 years.
The following reference is taken from Golden Meadow Mill, 1981 by D.
Coriett. ‘Until April of this year, the Mill has been in constant use. In the
1950’s because of the deterioration of the wheel, automatic machinery was
installed. The present tenants, Mr Cubbon and his family, were asked to
vacate the mill in May of this year, it will not be used as a mill again, as all the
machinery has been sold.’
The mill site is now used as the location of holiday homes. The corn mill itself
has been extensively restored although a building of similar size, formerly part
of the rope works, had to be demolished. This building is pictured in Golden
Meadow Mill, by Mrs D. Corlett (1981); a copy of it is included with this report.
Before the current owner bought the site, all of the machinery and workings
inside the threshing mill had been removed and the building was in a bad
condition. The machinery inside the mill was still in place and the new owners
found a reference in one of the buildings from the Moore family (who used to
own the mill), ordering that no machinery should be removed from the mill.
However Mr Humphries believes that all of the records of the mili were fost
long ago in a fire.
The mill roof was replaced 5 or 6 years ago. Also, 5 years ago the millpond
was allowed to drain as it was flooding the adjacent fields. In spite of this the
millrace and the sluice still exist and these are important features of the site.
Inside the mill there are prepared timbers with details which have been used
on the ceilings, indicating that this is a high status building. This characteristic
is consistent throughout the building so it could be an original feature. A
practical explanation for plaining down the timbers would be to prevent sacks
and other materiais from getting caught on the roof.
