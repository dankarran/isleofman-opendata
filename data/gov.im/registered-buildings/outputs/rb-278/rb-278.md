REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: Santon Railway Station
ADDRESS: Off the AS Douglas to Castletown Road, Malew
POST CODE: IM4 1E
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Santon & Malew Parish Commissioners
GRID REF: 312 722
Introduction
Santon station is situated 5 ¥ miles south from Douglas on the 15 mile, 3 foot gauge
line to Port Erin, The Douglas to Port Erin railway was opened to the public on the 1*
August 1874, one year after the Douglas to Peel line had opened.
‘Towards the end of the construction period, stringent economies were necessary to
allow completion of the line. The station list, dated October 1872, provided for all
station buildings on the line to be of wooden construction, though this was later re-
examined. Santon had not been on the original list of stations, however by October
1872 a station had been agreed, although it’s position and nature had yet to be
resolved.
At the time of the Port Erin Line's opening a mere ‘sentry box’ style of building had
been provided at Santon, This was moved to Port Soderick
the following year and the
current building at Santon erected.
Following the success of the line, a programme of station-building replacement was
‘commenced in the 1890's, however the amount of goods/passengers using Santon
didn’t warrant this investment and thus it retained it's wooden building.
History
The current wooden station building at Santon was built in 1875 and was one of three
similar structures that existed on the Isle of Man Railway when taken over by the
Manx Government in 1978. Colby’s was demolished in 1978 with Ballasalla’s following
suit in 1986. Santon itself was very nearly demolished in the early 1980's and would
have been but for the intervention of a Railway Society who paid for its repairs.
As can be seen in the layout drawing herewith (SA-001) the station site consists of a
passing loop and a siding which once served a Cattle Dock. The ‘manure’ siding, cart
road and cattle dock were added in 1910, subsequently an advertisement hoarding hid
it from the train. The cattle pen has long since gone, but the stone platform remains
and fs still used today for loading permanent way wagons. The station building has a
wooden frame to which overlapping wooden planks (weatherboard) are attached, the
roof is corrugated steel. The detall drawing SA-002 illustrates the building circa 1960
with the brick toilet and former 4-wheel brake that once existed alongside the
building. The van was E4 which was moved here in 1924, lifted off its underframe and

sited on a plinth built from stone. ‘The van was used for station storage purposes for
many years before finally being demolished in the early 1970's. The toilet had a zinc
tiled roof and originally had brick ‘castellations’ around the top which had been
removed by the late 1970's. The whole block finally succumbed in 1983,
Santon saw no trains whatsoever in 1966 when the entire Isle of Man Railway was
dosed. ‘The same was true in 1975 and 76 when only the short section operated;
Castletown to Port Erin in ‘75 and the slightly longer Ballasalla to Port Erin section in
‘76. Trains returned to the whole Douglas to Port Erin line for the 1977 season. Over
the years Santon lost most of it’s passengers to buses and cars, eventually becoming a
request stop. Occasionally the station would be manned for the brief period when
trains were due to cross, which usually meant a member of staff driving out by car
from Douglas. However it has now been some years since the station has been a
regular crossing place.
‘Apart from the 2002 season, the only time in recent years that the station has seen
any real activity is when it has been used as a Grotto for the Railway's Santa Trains.
During 2002 Santon rose to prominence when the Douglas to Port Erin line was
severed during the relay of the South line as part of IRIS, the Island Sewage Project.
The 2002 relay was between Santon and Castletown which meant that south bound
passengers would catch a train at Douglas, de-train at Santon and be forwarded on by
bus to Castletown, where they would rejoin another train for the run down to Port
Erin. Prior to this season the whole site had a makeover, new low-level platforms
were built, a temporary water tower erected, temporary toilets provided and the
building refurbished and waiting room reopened. Santon once again had a full time
Station Master during its brief tenure as the ‘Southern Terminus’ of the northern
section. The following year the relay was between Castletown and Port StMary and
Santon returned to being a sleepy backwater.
Currently the station building is in reasonable order, although it has not had any work
done to it since 2002 when the roof was repaired and the woodwork repainted. The
building itself is more or less in the condition illustrated in drawing SA-002, however
the station clock has long since disappeared and the windows are usually covered with
wooden shutters.
RECOMMENDATION
Santon Railway Station Is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register
for the following reasons;
P sc unt
* Wooden structure; weather board on a wooden frame with corrugated iron
roof.
Historic Interest
+ Santon is an example of a rural station whose main traffic was the transport of
cattle and agricultural produce in support of the local farming community.
Age
and Rarity
* The only survivor of three similar structures that existed on the Port Erin line
when taken over by the Manx Government in 1978.
* Dating from only 12 months after the lines opening, the ‘Heritage’ value of this
wooden structure should not be underestimated. Beside similar structures at
Colby (demolished in 1978) and Ballasalla (demolished in 1986), many of the

other stations along the line were similar prior to being rebuilt by the Isle of
Man Railway Company many years ago.
+ Overall this station site is the most complete of all the surviving Isle of Man
Railway Stations. The major detraction is that the yard is used for permanent
way purposes and often looks very untidy, some of the items stored here
should be kept elsewhere. With a little effort this site could be made into a
timeless example of an IMR station, dating little from 1875.
«The station building itself is a remarkable survivor; an original Port Erin line
wooden structure from 1875 - this factor alone should ensure its entry onto the
Protected Buildings Register.
