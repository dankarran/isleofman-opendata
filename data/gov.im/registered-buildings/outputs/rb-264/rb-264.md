REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Former World War Two Cinema and Gymnasium, latterly The Royal
British Legion Hall
ADDRESS: Bromet Road, Castletown
POST CODE: IM9 1BX
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Castletown Commissioners
GRID REF: 271 679
Introduction
The Royal British Legion Hall was constructed by the Admiralty as a cinema and gymnasium
during the Second World War. The building was located on the Castletown Camp which was
one of the domestic sites providing accommodation for the personnel of H.M.S. Urley, the Naval
Station at Ronaldsway.
The building is significant because it is the only surviving structure on any of the station's
domestic sites and it has remained largely in its original condition.
History
Suitable areas of flat ground were adopted as landing grounds during the early years of aviation
in the Isle of Man. A large field at Ronaldsway became a popular site for landing aircraft and a
civil aerodrome developed there during the early decades of the twentieth century.
During the early part of the Second World War, there were huge developments taking place at
Andreas and Jurby airfields, but there was little in comparison at Ronaldsway. Around the same
time, the Admiralty (responsibie for the command of the Royal Navy) was short of air stations
and needed further accommodation to train and house Its crews. The three sites in the Isle of
Man were looked at, but the RAF refused to give up Andreas or Jurby airfields and of the three,
Ronaldsway was the best site for the Station because of its position next to the sea (Isle of Man
Airport Website).
The decision to use Ronaldsway was made by the end of 1942 and in early 1943 the Manx
authorities were told of the Admiralty’s intentions to turn the area into a Roya! Naval Station.
Shortly after, the Admiralty compulsory purchased the large Ronaidsway estate, plus two
smaller adjacent farms, Ballagilley and the Creggans. In addition to this, "Accommodation off
the airfield for 2,000 naval personnel was required and land at Janet’s Corner, Castletown, and
in Ballasalla was purchased for this purpose.” (Kniveton G.N., 1985, p.64). The name ‘Janet's
Corner’ had no connection with the Station, but rather it simply came from a woman named
Stephen Moore, Building Conservation Officer 3

Janet Walkington who lived at the end of the nineteenth century and had a small shop on a
corner in the area now bearing her name (Mona’s Herald 02/02/1971 and 26/01/1971). Janet
Walkington was listed as a resident of Bowling Green Road in Browns Directory of 1894.
In 1943, works began to transform the site and the main contractor who was responsible for
the construction of the buildings, along with the airfield itself was John Laing & Sons., a Carlisle
firm. Materials were supplied from local sources, with sand and gravel coming from C. Kniveton
Ltd. of Braddan and from the Point of Ayre. There was also a plant which produced the
concrete blocks used in the construction of hundreds of Admiralty designed buildings (Kniveton
G.N., 1985).
The Naval Station at Ronaldsway was commissioned on 21° June 1944 and it was named
H.M.S. Urley, after the Manx name for eagle (Manx Electric Railway Society, 1999).
The British Legion Hall was at that time part of the Station’s Castletown Camp and a map of
"“HMS Uriey Castletown Camp 1945”shows that it was a domestic camp which once covered the
site now occupied by the Janet’s corner estate. The building now used as the Legion Hall
occupied a central position in the camp and the map referred to it as “Gymnasium & Cinema”
(Francis P., 2006, p.56). The naval workers were housed in the many Nissen huts sited there.
Following the end of the Second World War, the Admiralty no longer had a need for their
Station at Ronaidsway, or for the camps at Janet's Corner and Ballasalla. As a result of this, by
the end of 1945 the huts within the camps had become empty, on 14° January 1946 H.M.S.
Urley was decommissioned and on 28" August 1946 the ownership of Ronaldsway was
transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
The Isle of Man Government considered the empty camps at Janet’s Corner and Ballasalla to be
a possibie solution to the post-war housing shortage and in August 1946, Tynwald voted to
purchase both of the camps from the Admiralty (IOM Weekly Times, 17/08/46). The two sites
were excellent locations for temporary housing as the numerous Nissen huts could be easily
converted into homes, electricity and water was already supplied and the main bus route
between Douglas and Castletown was close by. In addition to this, the cinema at Janet's
Corner was said to be one of the “definite assets”
of the camps (IOM Weekly Times, 17/08/46,
p.5). The Nissen huts on the camps were converted into 2, 3 or 4 bedroom homes, with the
Ballasalla site being developed first, followed by Janet’s Corner where accommodation was
provided for 120 families (Isle of Man Airport website). It was felt that the Janet's Corner site
was an ideal location for development and that although the Nissen hut conversions would only
provide temporary accommodation, it was highly likely that there would be permanent homes
built at Janet’s Corner in time (Isle of Man Weekly Times, 19/10/46).
The Isle of Man Government purchased Ronaldsway airport in 1948 and in the same year they
approved a plan to replace the temporary Nissen huts at Janet’s Corner with 66 newly
constructed houses, The development teak place in stages until all the huts were removed,
leaving the gymnasium/cinema building as the only surviving World War Two structure on the
site.
Stephen Moore, Building Conservation Officer

In May 1960, the gymnasium/cinema building was given to the Castletown Branch of the Royal
British Legion by Tynwald for no charge and it has remained in their ownership to the present
day (November 2007).
Architecture
The building is a standard cinema construction, which was designed by the Admiralty to their
drawing number AL13/43 (Francis P., 2006).
The structure comprises three distinct sections. The first is a two-storey brick-built end section,
the second is a central Romney Shed which forms the main portion of the building, and the
third is a small brick-built building at the far end, which replaced an earlier 16ft span Nissen hut
which formerly stood on the site.
Nissen huts were a First World War invention and they continued to be used as the main
building type for living accommodation during World War Two. Romney Sheds were larger than
Nissen Huts and they were designed mainly for storage purposes by the Directorate of
Fortifications and Works at Romney House, London in 1943. Romney Sheds were sometimes
modified in order to be used as workshops, boiler houses, canteens or cinemas (Francis P.,
2006).
The main entrance is in the two-storey brick-built end section. Here at ground level there is a
crush hall, ticket office and toilets. Above this at first floor level there is a projection room
centred between a cinema jaboratory and a rewind room.
The main section of the building is the Romney Shed, which forms the auditorium. The
Romney Shed is a standard sized shed, being 12 bays long and 96ft in length. The external
covering to the shed is corrugated asbestos sheeting. The interior of the auditorium is open
plan with a stage at the far end and four emergency exits evenly-spaced with two on either
side. The emergency exits have each retained their brick-built blackout porches. Behind the
stage there is a link to the brick-built extension where there is a dressing room. This extension
replaced a 16ft Nissen hut which once stood on the site.
CONCLUSION
The British Legion Hall at Janet’s Corner is the only surviving H.M.S. Urley structure on the
Janet’s Corner site and it has also remained largely unaltered since its construction, still
retaining its original entrance foyer, dance floor, stage and projection room.
The building should be given careful consideration for Registration as it is a World War Two
survivor which has retained its original equipment and fittings and it is therefore considered to
be important in a British Isles context (Francis P., 2006).
Stephen Moore, Building Conservation Officer

RECOMMENDATION
The British Legion Hall is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for the
following reasons;
Historic Interest:
This building illustrates an important aspect of the Island’s social and military history. It is also
of historic interest in the local context of Castletown, the Island, and in a National (British Isles)
context (Francis P., 2006).
Close Historical Association:
The building is closely linked with the impact of World War Two on the Island.
Age and Rarity:
Whilst certainly not ancient, it is a World War Two survivor which has retained its original
equipment and fittings and it is therefore considered to be important in a British Isles context
(Francis P., 2006 — Paul Francis is the recognized expert on World War Two structures in the
United Kingdom).
