REGISTERED BUILDING CONMFIRMATION
NAME: Greystones Cottage
ADDRESS: Main Road, Kirk Michael
POST CODE: IM6 1ER
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Michael Commissioners
GRID REF: 317 907
Introduction
Greystones Cottage is a small two-storey property located in the centre of Kirk Michael
village. The cottage is situated on the Main Road through the village and positioned at
a right-angle to the road, facing northwards in the direction of the Parish Church.
The property is believed to be one of the oldest properties in Kirk Michael, dating from
the late eighteenth century. Greystones remained in the ownership of the same family
(The Cannan family) from at least the early eighteenth century until the 1960's.
The most significant feature of Greystones is the Manx slate roof, from which the
property may have been given its name. The Manx slate roof is an extremely rare
survival and Greystones is the only property in the village with this feature.
History
Greystones is thought to have been built around 1778. There used to be a date
carved into the lintel above the entrance, but this has been removed or covered up
during alterations.
Kirk Michael village is a linear settlement, stretching in a north-south direction. The
majority of the older properties are located along the Main Road and at the time the
1869 Ordnance Survey Map was plotted there was almost a total absence of
development away from Main Road.
The oldest properties in the village are generally those closest to the church,
suggesting the church was the nucleus for the development of the village. These old
properties tend to be directly abutting the pavement, with later buildings having a
forecourt or garden area between the dwelling and the highway. Greystones is 1 of 5
older properties which were built directly onto the pavement, around the church. The
others include Mona House, Mona Cottage, Church Cottage and Maxwell Cottage.
A Survey on the ‘Age of Buildings’ in Kirk Michael was carried out by Oxford Brookes
University in 1999 on behalf of Michael Heritage Trail. They found that only a small
number of buildings in the present village were constructed before 1910 and only a

handful of these were constructed before 1800, with Greystones being one of the
oldest properties in the village.
It has been suggested that Greystones was built by John Cannan of Cooil Shellagh
Farm, Kirk Michael, although he died on 21% October 1773, aged 82, which pre-dates
1778, the suggested date of construction. Both he and his son William, who died on
3" November 1807, are buried in Kirk Michael Parish Church graveyard.
The first written reference to Greystones is found in 1825, when it came into the
possession of Jane Cannan and William Lewis, on the condition that they “meet at
Michael Parish Church within a month of the date hereof to join together in the Holy
Estate of Matrimony God and his Holy Church permitting”. This agreement was made
by Catherine Skillicorn (alias Cannan), who was the mother of Jane Cannan. The
agreement was dated 1* August 1825 and the marriage had taken place by 17"
February 1826.
The Cannan family of Kirk Michael can be traced back in the male line to John Cannan,
who bought Cooil Shellagh Quarterland just south of Kirk Michael in 1689. Members
of the family feature in Directories for Kirk Michael throughout the nineteenth century
when some of them were farmers at Cooil Shellagh, with a John Cannan being a
farmer in the village of Kirk Michael (possibly Greystones) in Thwaite’s Directory of
1863, although the name of Greystones at this time is not known. This Directory also
said that the Post Office for the village was at John Cannan’s, although it is unclear
which property this was. Wood’s Atlas of 1867 also refers to a John Cannan (or
Cannon) who was a landowner in the village, possibly the same individual as in the
Directory.
In May 1932 the tenant of the property was John James Kaighen, so the Cannan
family must have been living elsewhere during certain periods. Greystones remained
in the ownership of the Cannan family until 4° January 1967, when it was sold by
John Harold Cannan to Mrs G. Shaw.
Originally Greystones had a large garden at the rear of the property, in addition to two
nearby fields known as the Llhanneys which were adjoining where the Isle of Man
Railway line was later constructed (and subsequently removed). In 1825 the property
was described as having boundaries with “the road leading to the Preaching House
and the King’s Highroad to the other side and William Quayle, Blacksmith’s property on
the West” At some point in time, probably during the 1920’s, a house known as
Beechcroft was built in the rear garden and still occupies the site to this day.
In 1967 the boundaries were described as being adjacent to the Ramsey to Michael
highroad on the West, bordering open space to the North, a lane to the East and the
property known as ‘Beechcroft’ to the South.
Architecture
External:
Although there have been many alterations to the appearance of Greystones over the
years, the overall form and volume of the cottage is substantially original. It is a
prominent building on Main Road, Kirk Michael and it is seen by many people as they

pass through the village. Greystones is distinctive for its vernacular form, roof finish,
and for being situated at an unusua! right-angle to the Main Road.
The external walls are two feet thick and made of stone, infilled with rubble. They
would have originally been whitewashed, although they are currently pebble-dashed
with the exception of the rear elevation which is still painted white.
The stones of the Manx slate roof are laid in reducing courses with the smaller slates
at the top and the larger slates at the bottom. The roof is a prominent feature of the
property and is clearly visible from the road. Therefore, the loss of this roof would be
detrimental to the appearance of the Kirk Michael Conservation Area.
At ground level, immediately to the rear of the property is an old drain which would
have intercepted run off water from the roof and drained it towards the road,
underneath the wall and across the pavement. You can still see the remains of this
drain across the pavement today.
The two large dormer windows on the front elevation are a later addition to this
property. Like many traditional Manx cottages there were originally three much
smaller window openings on the first floor of the front elevation. Similar sized
openings can be seen on the side and rear elevations of the property. An archive
photograph dating from the 1930’s shows the original window openings to the front
elevation. All of the front windows to the property are modern casements and are not
in any way historically correct.
Internal: Ground Floor
You enter the property via a single storey porch, which is clearly a modern addition.
There was originally no front porch to the property, as can be seen in the archive
photograph, with the front door directly stepping onto the street.
The interior is subdivided via a centrally located staircase into two rooms on the
ground floor which would have originally been the parlour and the kitchen. The large
Manx cooking range which would have stood in the kitchen is now blocked off and the
wall is much thicker where the range originally was. This room is partitioned to the
rear, parallel to the rear longitudinal wall to form a Bathroom. This is clearly relatively
modern with floor to ceiling ceramic tiles and a window in the partition offering
borrowed light from the Kitchen.
The Kitchen itself is also finished in a relatively modern manner with floor to ceiling
ceramic tiling and modern kitchen units fitted against the dividing partition with the
Bathroom. The only apparent remnants of historic interest are the ceiling / floor joists
and what appears to be the remains of the Chiollagh in the gable end wall.
Situated behind the staircase, parallel with the rear wall is a modern toilet, lit by a
smail casement window. The exterior wall is tiled in modern ceramic tiles and the
space appears to have little of historic significance.
To the right of the entrance and down a step, is what may well have been the Parlour.
This room spans from front to back and is pretty unremarkable save the ceiling / floor
joists and remains of the hearth in the gable end wall onto the Main Street. This wall

is vertically timbered in a modern fashion and the stove situated in the hearth appears
to be a modern Victorian copy. :
Internal: First Floor
The ‘Landing’ to the top of the stairs is wider than the width of the stairs by almost the
width again. There is evidence that perhaps the current stair location has not always
been in its current position as there are what could be chamfered newel posts either
site of a blocked up opening in the slope of the roof.
Entering the Bedroom to the right off the top of the Landing via a ledged, timber
planked door of Victorian origin chamfered to match the slope of the roof, you are
immediately aware of one of the two Principle Trusses supporting purlins at door top
height. The room is unremarkable other than the previously mentioned timber
partitions and the dormer window to the front elevation which is clearly a later
addition.
Entering the Bedroom on the left hand side off the Landing via a similar, though
square topped ledged door reveals the second Principle Truss. Also evident is a smail
opening to the left hand side of the chimney breast. There is possibly another to the
right hand side, but this is obscured by a modern, built in cupboard. Other than the
dormer in the front elevation as the other Bedroom, the previously mentioned gable
end window and truss, this is an unremarkable room.
RECOMMENDATION
Greystones cottage is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Buildings Register for
the following reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
Despite the alterations to the appearance of Greystones over the years, the property is
distinctive for its vernacular form, the rare survival of the diminished coursed Manx
slate roof and for being situated at an unusual right-angle to the Main Road, facing the
parish church which was an important historical site.
Close Historic Association
The Cannan family who were a well-known farming family of Michael parish owned
Greystones from the late eighteenth century until as recently as the 1960's.
Landmark Qualities
Although only diminutive in size, and due to its now unusual diminished coursed roof,
Greystones is a prominent building on Main Road in Kirk Michael and it is therefore
seen by many people as they pass through the village.
Age and Rarity
Greystones dates from at least the late eighteenth century and is one of the oldest
properties in Kirk Michael village. The parish church was an important historic site due
va

to the nearby location of Bishopscourt and it was also the nucleus for the expansion of
the village. The proximity of the parish church and the position at which Greystones
was built in relation to it, would support the suggestion that this is one of the oldest
properties in the village.
The diminished coursed Manx slate roof is a rare survival and makes an important
contribution to the Kirk Michael Conservation Area.
