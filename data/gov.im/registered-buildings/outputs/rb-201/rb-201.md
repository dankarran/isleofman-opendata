QUEEN’S HOTEL, QUEEN’S PROMENADE,
DOUGLAS
Introduction
The Queen’s Hotel, an I.o.M. Breweries managed public house, on Queen’s
Promenade is located towards the Onchan end of the sweeping promenade
overlooking Douglas Bay.
Dated at pre 1826 it is thought that it was built as cottages and stabling for the Castle
Mona. It is unknown when it first became a public house but it was probably in the
early 1800’s when it is believed it was called the Crescent Hotel, adopting its name
from the Crescent the former name of that stretch of the Queen’s Promenade.
Certainly by 1854 it was called the Queen’s Hotel and another property, further along
the Promenade towards Onchan, at some time had the name the Crescent Hotel
(Paramount City).
Pre-dating many of the present day promenade buildings its style and size contrasts to
the rows of tall terraced hotels and guest houses, built to accommodate the mass
tourist market of the Victorian era, and the modern apartment blocks.
Architectural Interest
The designer and builder of the building are unknown.
The external appearance of the front elevation of the building, saving a few minor
differences, is thought to be very much as it would have looked 150 years ago and
possibly earlier. It was in 1854 the balcony was added, although it is unlikely that the
same balcony has survived all these years.
On several occasions when the Queen’s changed hands the internal layout, fixtures
and fittings were altered, although some of the upper floors may have escaped serious
change since 1892.
The majority of external alterations, additions/disposals, have been made during the
ownership of Heron and Brearley, but mostly to peripheral items such as outbuildings
and the above ground beer ‘cellar’.
Historic Interest
It is not known that any specific historic event is associated to this building, but it has
obviously played an important role in the development of the tourist trade to the
Island, having been once considered one of the more comfortable and sanitary hotels
available.
Close Historic Association
Its association with the Castle Mona, owned by the Derby family, is its stronges
known historical link to famous or influential persons.

Group Value
The Queen’s is very much an individual building, being very different to its
surrounding neighbours, even in more historic times.
Age & Rarity
This building almost certainly dates back to the 1700’s when the northern part of
Douglas Promenade was only just starting to be developed. Not only does this give it
rarity value in age but its style and pattern of use is also unusual. The fact that the
Queen’s has survived as a public house for more than 150 years is in itself notable.
Conclusions
This buildings has many reasons to commend it, its age, its links to an historic family,
the length of time it has served the island as a hotel and public house, but not least
because it very much retains its earliest known appearance.
