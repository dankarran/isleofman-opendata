recommendation
ey
&
Phe building has architecturs] significaie in that it is one oi é
few examples of design by an internationally recognisel architect. The
style is egsin « blend of "shingle" and pseudo tudor but imaginatively
resolved.the siting is some rbat cramped to the front but expansive +o
the rear.
in the ¢7396 that not all of the Bailiie Scott houses were to de listed
then it is judged that Ivydene and the Red House are ouperiors to Oakleigh.

Oakleigh, Glencrutchery Road, Douglas, 1893
Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott
This building is considered worthy of entry in the Protected Buildings
Register being one of the major works of the internationally renowned
Architect Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott.
Following a period of some three years spent in articles with Maj
Charles E Davis, City Architects of Bath, Baillie Scott accompanied by
his recent Bride, came to the Isle of Man on Honeymoon and during an
interview some years later with John Betjeman, Editor of the
Architectural Review, Scott recalled, "I went to the Isle of Man for a
holiday. I was so seasick I couldn't face the journey back, so I set up
practice there”.
In the fullness of time Baillie Scott came to know Archibald Knox the
local born artist whose fame also spread beyond these shores. The two
were later to collaborate in the design and fabrication of architectural
features such as stained glass, copper repoussé fireplace hoods, iron
gates and such like incorporated into some of Baillie Scotts houses in
the Isle of Man.
Baillie Scott was destined to become an Architect of international
repute designing properties throughout England and as far afield as
Switzerland and Russia.
His works in the Isle of Man form a record of his early development: his
sensitive and creative use of craftsmanship and materials together with a
quite revolutionary approach to internal planning and inter-relationship
of spaces not seen before in English circles.
Whilst on the Island Baillie Scott began submitting illustrated articles
to building magazines, which was to prove fortunate, as his office

records were later destroyed in two office fires.
Baillie Scott has long been recognised as an Architect of good quality
Arts and Crafts buildings, however with the gradual discovery of more of
his works and of the recognition of their standing alongside other
acknowledged masters of the period such as Voysey, Webb, Lethaby, Ashbee,
Mackintosh and Lutyens, his reputation is increasing in stature in major
terms.
Accordingly, it is of vital importance that those buildings which Baillie
Scott designed in the Isle of Man and which remain substantially in their
original form should be entered in the Protected Buildings Register.
Built for one of Baillie Scott's builders, W Macadam in 1893, the plan
form shows Scott's developing ideas for the ideal arrangement of rooms.
He makes excellent use of changes in level for reception rooms: the Hall
and Drawing Room being placed on a higher level than the Dining Room and
Kitchen Areas.
Detailing of an original nature which Scott was to develop as a
trademark, appear here: for example the octagonal bay has an almost
tower-like appearance.
The Dining Room furniture is built in and consists of a carved oak mantel
with cabinets and recessed sideboard on the opposite wall. Some movable
pieces of oak furniture are so like the fixed features that it is likely
that they were also designed by Baillie Scott.
There was no inglenook in the original design, however one has been
incorporated during recent years by the present owners. There is,
however, a well-proportioned (French) medieval, carved stone fireplace in
the Hallway.
Another Scott trademark is seen in the single storey porch taking the
form of a miniature of the house.

Sourtss
The roadside fagade is picturesque owing much to the medieval vernacular
revival in Cheshire. On the garden elevation, tile hanging is used
extensively and the massing is more weighty.
The property is presently undergoing some work by way of extension and
repairs: this is being sensitively handled after due consultation with a
local Architectural Historian and with the Planning Authority.
This building makes an important contribution to the built Heritage of
the Isle of Man.
