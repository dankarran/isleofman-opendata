1, ALBERT TERRACE,
DOUGLAS
Background
This building was among those proposed at the Public Enquiry into the Revision of the
Douglas Local Plan, in June, 1997 as being worthy and due for consideration for entry
into the Protected Buildings Register. The description of the property on the list
proposed describes it as “J, Albion Terrace, (junction with Windsor Road)” mainly
because Albert Terrace is not actually shown on current mapping, probably due to the
fact that all but two of the properties were demolished in recent years being replaced by
a sheltered housing complex known as Reayrt Ny Baie - or Bay View: Albion Terrace
which was a later extension of Albert Terrace still exists, as does the property in
question being located at the junction of Albert Terrace with Windsor Road and is
correctly known as I, Albert Terrace.
Historical notes
George Steuart, the Architect perhaps best known for his work on the Castle Mona and
the Red Pier Complex, purchased a large portion of the Joyner Estate in 1805.
It passed, upon his death to his son Robert, at one time Receiver General for the Isle of
Man, but Robert died at a relatively young age leaving his widow, Marie to administer
the Estate. Marie proved to be a shrewd business woman and having gradually

increased her holding of land, began to sell off parcels of land for development
purposes.
John Crellin of Ramsey, purchased a part of the Joyner’s Estate from Marie Steuart of
Marina Lodge (detached house in Villa Marina grounds) in 1846. He laid out the estate
~ Windsor Park - such as to have a principal thoroughfare running from Ramsey Road
through to Finch Road. The Eastern part of this route (Windsor Road) cut directly
through one of the steepest sections of the broogh following the line of an existing
gulley. Crellin’s Hill, as it became known, was dug by hand and its retaining walls
remain as evidence of this remarkable feat of engineering. Initially it was gated at either
end being the entrance to the private estate.
Crellin engaged the Architect John Robinson to design Windsor Terrace, and several
other terraces in the area have a distinctive Robinson approach to their design, as does
the house in question, number 1, Albert Terrace.
Built in 1847, Albert Terrace was originally called Osborne Terrace, after the Royal
retreat on the Isle of Wight, it then became Albert Terrace . In 1849 the detached house,
Number 1, was built for Robert Boardman who was the agent for the “Monarch
Steamboat Company” and the two “Liver Birds” which until very recently, graced the
roof parapet of the property, are said to have once been perched on top of the roof of the
company’s offices, which had stood on the Douglas quay side, close to the Double
Corner (North Quay).

le
Design
The building is well proportioned and with its two principal storeys, takes on an almost
cuboidal form giving one of the few opportunities to view a Robinson building
virtually “in the round” as opposed to his terraced compositions. The elevation fronting
onto Windsor Road is basically symmetrical and is largely unspoiled save for the loss
of the lower section of the central pilaster. Windows are almost certainly original, or at
least are in the original style being six pane upon six, timber, vertically sliding sashes.
All windows on this elevation retain their decorative hoodmouldings which as well as
adding a sense of elegance, provide unifying element to the overall design. Other
architectural features such as pilasters framing panels in the principal elevations;
horizontal string courses; parapet wall surmounting the principal elevations together
with well proportioned chimney stacks, all also serve to give a sense of order and
symmetry to the building. The existing porch is a later alteration, as are the railings to
the perimeter walls. The property had at one time, a fine town garden which now is
occupied by a series of lock-up shops and garages.
The building is significant in its contribution in several ways:-
Historically, it was one of the first properties to be built in the Windsor Park
development and is a gate house to this group which comprises Cambridge Terrace,
Osborne Terrace, Windsor Terrace, Albion Terrace and Albert Terrace,and Number 1,
Albert Terrace provides a flavour of the architectural style and language developed in
the Park itself.

e The property occupies a prominent site at an important road junction in Douglas and as
such is well known and recognised achieving a “landmark” quality; this quality would
be enhanced with the reinstatement of the lately removed Liver Birds on the parapet of
the building.
e@ The Windsor Park Estate was developed partly in the political climate which lead to the
decision to move the Governor of the Island from Castletown, to Douglas by 1862, and
the relocation of the House of Keys from Castletown to Douglas in 1869. There
followed a gradual migration to Douglas which resulted in the demand for a high
standard of accommodation and architecture as evidenced by Windsor Park. Number 1,
Albert Terrace survives to bear witness to that social and political development in our
history and occupies a most important position, both physically and historically.
e The property is associated with the renowned local architect John Robinson, and is one
of the few examples of a detached property on this modest scale.
Accordingly, Number 1 Albert Terrace is entered into the Protected Buildings
Register on the following grounds:-
1. The Architectural merit and aesthetic value of the building;
2. The building’s association with the renowned local Architect, John Robinson.
3. The building’s significance within the immediate locality as well as the
contribution which it makes to the streetscape of Douglas as a whole;
4. The association of the building with Robert Boardman and the contribution which
the building has made in marking the sociological and historical development of
the town of Douglas.
