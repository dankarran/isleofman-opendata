Registry Entry Summary – Santon Parish Church (St Sanctain’s) 
 
Details 
Name: Santon Parish Church (St Sanctain’s) 
Address: Church Road, Santon IM4 1EZ 
Register Entry Number: 15 
Date of Registration: 21.07.1983 
 
History 
The site is known to have been used for Christian worship since approximately 500AD. The present 
building was erected in 1774, being a rebuild of a building constructed between 1720 and 1730. 
 
The church is dedicated to Saint Sanctain, an Irish Saint and Bishop. During the 17th century, St 
Sanctain’s connection with the church was forgotten, with the church mistakenly dedicated to St 
Ann. This mistake was perpetuated in Blundell’s account of the island in 1648. The last reference to 
St Ann in the church registers was in 1822, when further uncertainty occurred with the church 
dedication attributed to St Anne. This spelling lasted until 1891, when the restoration of the 
dedication to Saint Sanctain appears to have occurred. 
 
A new pitched roof was constructed in 1932, and at this time a number of pews were removed to 
make room for the existing chancel. The vestry was formed in 1951, and in 1952 the east wall’s 
stained glass window was installed. 
 
Form and Materials 
The church is constructed of local stone, rendered externally and painted white. The roof is 
supported by timber A-frame trusses, with purlins, rafters and close boarded timber panels all visible 
from the interior. The roof is finished in natural slate (Welsh). The internal walls are timber panelled 
to dado height. 
 
The church has a simple rectangular form, with a bell tower on the western gable. A gallery is 
present at the western end, accommodating the organ and additional seating at gallery level and 
under which the vestry and baptistry have been constructed. 
 
Against the western internal wall, adjacent to the baptistry, are three stone crosses. Two depict 
forms of the cross. The third is believed to be the only engraved stone of its type on the island. The 
stone’s Latin inscription reads ‘A VITI MONOMENTI’ – meaning the tomb of Avitus. No facts are 
known about the identity of the Manx Avitus. The style is similar to monuments found in Cornwall, 
south west Wales and southern Scotland. The name Avitus may indicate contact between the island 
and continental Europe, as the name was popular in northern France.
