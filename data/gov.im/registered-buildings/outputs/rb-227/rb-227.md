REGISTERED BUILDING PROPOSAL
NAME: Laxey Working Mens Institute
ADDRESS: 17 New Road, Laxey
POST CODE: IM4 7BF
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Laxey
GRID REF: 432 844
History
In 1861, a request appeared in the press for an Institute within Laxey. The purpose of such
institutes being to improve the mind of the working class fraternity, specifically the males.
It wasn’t until June 1876 that land was purchased ftom Captain Richard Rowe on which to
build dedicated premises and on 3" September 1876 the foundation stone was laid by Allured
Dumbell then High Bailiff of Ramsey to a design by J Cowle of Douglas. On the 4” May
1877 George Dumbell, Chairman of the mining Company and MHK performed the opening
ceremony.
In the early years the institute was very successful, with Laxey being a mining town there was
no shortage of suitable members. The hall was also used for a multitude of community
functions including meetings of various clubs and societies, concerts and civic events. It was
also used as a cinema in the 1920’s.
In the early 1890’s the future of the building was briefly threatened by one of the optional
routes for the new electric tramway.
In 1920/21 the building became known as the YMCA Hall but soon reverted back to its old
name.
The widening of the road bridge in the 1960’s saw the loss of a section of front wall and a
piece of privately owned land immediately in front of the building.
Architectural Interest
Exterior
The buildings principle elevation faces south, overlooking the Glen Ruy Valley at the
northern end of Moore’s Bridge. It abuts Montague House to the north and the entrance is in
the west gable elevation facing New Road. The building is built over two storeys with the
entrance directly to the upper floor. It is constructed from Manx stone in a Gothic style with a
rendered finish.
The southern elevation is split into three sections. Two gablet roof end sections project
slightly forward of a central section. The central section is divided into three bays with lancet
windows and drip mouldings above, over low arched windows. The two end sections have a
pair of flat arched windows also over low arched windows. The west end section upper floor
windows have a lancet drip moulding over whilst the eastern upper floor pair of lancet
windows have a flat drip moulding over. These windows also project slightly forward of the

elevation. All the windows are sliding sash split one third over two thirds. The lower sashes
are further split with central horizontal glazing bars. The upper floor central windows have a
trefoil design to the upper sashes. The two storeys are divided by a pair of string courses.
Below the cills of the lower windows the elevation is left as Manx stone.
The west elevation doorway onto New Road has rendered pilasters with a lancet moulding
over, undemeath a peaked gablet. A pair of narrow, square panelled, doors sit inside.
Alongside the entrance is a lancet window with a drip moulding over.
To the east there is a lower floor window and a flat roofed kitchen extension. Access is
available from Church Hill where there is a stone wall boundary.
Interior
The upper level is an open area for meetings, concerts etc with a timber entrance lobby and a
small stage at the east end. Access to the lower level is via two staircases, one from the
entrance lobby and one from alongside the stage. Two ceiling roses exist and parts of the
rafters are visible as they cut across the junction of the ceiling with the wall.
The jower level is subdivided by folding doors at each end. One set separating the reading
room from the games room and the other set at the eastern end separating the staircase and
storage area also from the games room. Access is gained to a cellar off the reading room,
which housed the coal hole. A fireplace exists but unfortunately the surround is missing and
the hearth is damaged.
Landmark Qualities
This building occupies a dominant site within Laxey. Viewed from the Douglas approach it
stands at the end of Moore’s Bridge with clear views of its southern and western elevations.
This building is very prominent and makes a valuable contribution to the village scene.
Group Value
The institute sits alongside Montague house and the village post office as a short terrace. The
southern elevation of the institute is closely mirrored by the former Laxey Glen Hotel and
creates a gateway off the bridge.
Recommendation
The Laxey Workings Mens Institute has played an important role in all aspects of community
life and in many of the leading events of the village.
We recommend the institute for inclusion on the Register of Protected Buildings.
