REGISTERED BUILDING CONFIRMATION
NAME: Orrisdale House
ADDRESS: Orrisdale, Kirk Michael
POST CODE: IM6 2HP
LOCAL AUTHORITY: Michael Commissioners
GRID REF: 325 930
Introduction
Orrisdale House is a large residence situated in a secluded nook on the west coast of
the Island, just north of Kirk Michael. The treen of Orrisdale is steeped in history and
was once thought to be the site of a Viking settlement and residence. In addition to
this, the treen possesses an old quartz mine dating back to the 12" century, the
remains of a white quartz circle and early Christian burials.
The area is populated with many large trees which are likely to be of a significant age.
The 1869 Ordnance Survey map of the area includes many of these trees and
describes the area around Orrisdale House as a ‘wood’.
The actual date
of construction of the present Orrisdale House is unknown. We can
assume that the oldest parts of the house date back to at least the time when
Deemster John Frisself Crellin (1764-1816) lived there. This is because a drawing
dating from that time shows the properly, clearly recognisable, although it has been
largely extended since.
Historically, Orrisdale has been the seat of the Crellin family for over 200 years. The
Crellins are one of the most distinguished families in the north of the Island and
although some of the family migrated to Ballachurry in Andreas, the old Orrisdale
House remains in Crellin hands to the present day.
History
In the Manorial Roll of 1515 the estate was known as Orestall, but it has also been
called Oristal, Orristal and the Norse-sounding Orry’s Dale. There have been many
Norse artefacts unearthed on the estate and where the land reaches the west coast a
number of pre-Christian and early Christian burials have been found. There used to
be a chapel and graveyard called Keeill Pharlane, which was located at Orrisdale Head
and during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries coastal erosion was noted to be
causing the graves to fall into the sea. A small portion of the keeill site was Included
on the 1869 Ordnance Survey map, although all traces have since been washed away.

The Crellin family of Orrisdale
The estate of Orrisdale first came into possession of the Crellin family in the mid to
late eighteenth century and it has remained in their hands ever since. There have
been many notable members of the Crellin family, including a Deemster, a Colonel in
Command of the Northern Manks Volunteers, a Vicar-General, a Captain of the Parish
and several MHK’s.
Rev. John Crellin (b. 1737, d. 1808)
Orrisdale quarterland came into the hands of the Crellin family when it was purchased
by the Rev. John Crellin.
In 1761 he was appointed Chaplain of Ballure Chapel in Ramsey. This was followed in
1771 with the position of Vicar of Michael and the Episcopal Registrar, and in 1798
with the Rector of Bride and Vicar General.
In 1774 the well-known naturalist and traveller, Thomas Pennant (1726-1798) came to
the Isle of Man and he was supplied with descriptions of each of the parishes by the
vicars. Only the accounts of Michael, Ballaugh and Marown have survived, with the
description of Michael parish being written by Rev. John Crellin,
John Crellin married Margaret Frissell, the daughter of John Frissell, who was the
attorney-general. He resigned in 1808 and died that year at his home, Orrisdale
House.
Deemster John Frissell Crellin (b. 1764, d, 1816)
He was the son of the Rev. John Crellin and Margaret (née Frissell). He married
Charlotte Christian of Ballachurry, Andreas. Some of the Crellin family moved from
Orrisdale to Ballachurry and it is likely that the Andreas farm came into Crellin hands
through this marriage.
John Frissel Crellin was elected as a Member of the House of Keys in 1793 and was
High-Bailiff of Ramsey until 1796, when he was appointed northern Deemster. In
1814 he was appointed southern Deemster and he began to build Beach House in
Castletown with the intention of living there, but he died before its completion.
He was the last known Deemster to conduct his court in Manx and was also said to
have been one of the pioneer scientific farmers (Kniveton G.N., 1997).
Deemster Crellin was described as being “an accomplished lawyer and an excellent
judge, he also did good service to his country as Commander of the Northern Battalion
of the Manx Volunteers.” (Moore A.W., 1901). The Northern Manks Volunteers was
founded in October 1803 and the headquarters of the organisation were at Deemster
Crellin’s house, Orrisdale. After his death his widow Margaret was presented with the
colours of the regiment on his behalf, following the Battle of Waterloo.
Deemster Crellin had a road named in his honour. Bishop Murray (Bishop from 1814
to 1827) was known for having an interest in construction improvements and
alterations and he rebuilt much of Bishopscourt in a gothic style. He was said to have
been behind the creation of the road leading from Orrisdale to the Ramsey highroad

which then became known as ‘Deemster's Road’, after Deemster John Frissell Crellin,
although it is now referred to as ‘Orrisdale Road’.
The oldest parts of the present day Orrisdale House date back to at least the time
when Deemster John Frissell Crellin and lived there. This is due to the fact that there
is a drawing of Orrisdale House which dates from that time and shows the property
before it was largely extended.
John Christian Crellin (b, 1788, d. 1842)
He was born at Orrisdale and was the son of Deemster John Frissell Crellin and
Charlotte (née Christian).
He married Catherine Quayle, a member of the well-known Quayle family from
Castletown. He became MHK in 1816 and again in 1830 and was recorded as being
the proprietor of the majority of Orrisdale quarterland in Wood's Atlas of 1867.
John Frissell Crellin (b, 1816, d. 1886.
He was the eldest son of John Christian Crellin of Orrisdale and his wife Catherine (née
Quayle).
He was born, lived and died at Orrisdale House and married Annie Parsons. He
studied medicine at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and returned to Orrisdale following his
father’s death in 1842, where he made use of his medical knowledge by treating the
poor in the neighbourhood.
In 1843 he was elected a Member of the House of Keys and he remained a member
until 1874, acting for many years as deputy-speaker. His interests included
archaeology and coinage. He was one of the members of the committee who were
appointed by Governor Loch in 1876 to report on the antiquities of the Island and his
knowledge of Manx coinages was said to be unrivalled.
John Christian Crellin (b. 1853, d. 1913)
He was the son of John Frissell Crellin and Annie (née Parsons),
He married Sophie Anderson and they lived at Orrisdale House and also Ballachurry in
Andreas. He became Captain of the Parish of Ballaugh in 1883 and was MHK from
1881 to 1907.
Architecture
Orrisdale House is a large Manx mansion house which has been extended in the past,
giving it an unusual elongated appearance. The property is located In a quiet nook
and it faces onto ‘Orrisdale Road’ so it can be clearly seen by anyone passing by,
making it an important feature of the local area.
A drawing of the property which was made during the time when John Crellin was
northern Deemster (1796-1814) shows the house was originally a typical two storey
Manx house with five windows on the first floor across the front elevation. There were

single storey extensions either side of the main house. The front door can be seen in
this old drawing and unusually, it was located in the extension to the left of the main
house (facing on) and this has remained the location of the front door to this day.
The boundary wall to the road appears to be in the same location and is the same
height as in the archive drawing, although the pillars and gate were located directly in
front of the house in the drawing and today they are offset to one side. There may
have been some artistic licence with the drawing however, and an archive photograph
from the late nineteenth century shows the pillars and gate were then positioned
where they are today.
Since the time when the archive drawing was made, a first floor has been added over
the extension to the right of the main house (facing on). This extension matches the
original property in its size and by the placement of the first floor windows, which are
set out equally with the older first floor windows. The ground floor windows appear to
be in their original position (as shown in the archive drawing) and therefore they do
not match the positions of the newer windows above. This extension had been
completed by the time the first Ordnance Survey map was surveyed in 1869, so it is
likely to date from around the mid-nineteenth century. An archive photograph taken
of the property in 1954 shows that at that time there was a chimney stack located in
the centre of the building where the original house would have ended, although this
has since been removed.
The property has a simple style, which is typical of many old Manx houses. It is
smooth rendered, painted a light colour and has a pitched slate roof with
chimneystacks at either end of the main body of the house. The sliding sash windows
have been retained and these are in the same Georgian style as in the archive
drawing, being six over six panes. There are a total of seventeen windows on the
front elevation and due to this, the sliding sash windows are a significant feature of
this property.
Other buildings
There are old cottages located near to the main house which have been renovated
and are now used as tourist accommodation and there are also further outbuildings on
the site. These buildings were included on the 1869 Ordnance Survey Map.

RECOMMENDATION
Orrisdale House is suggested for inclusion on the Protected Bulldings Register for the
following reasons;
Architectural Interest and Aesthetic Quality
Orrisdale House is a Manx mansion house which has been extended, giving it an
unusual elongated appearance. There are seventeen windows on the front elevation
and they are sliding sash in the Georgian style with six over six panes, making them
an important characteristic of this property.
The property is situated in a secluded nook on the west coast of the Island, populated
by many large trees. Being such a large building which faces onto ‘Orrisdale Road’,
Orrisdale House is an important feature of the local area.
Historic Interest
The estate of Orrisdale is steeped in history. A derivation of the name Orrisdale was
included as far back as the Manorial Roll of 1515. The estate is thought to have been
an ancient Viking settlement and there have been many Norse artefacts unearthed
here. The remains have also been found of a 12 century quartz mine, an ancient
white quartz circle, pre-Christian burials and a small chapel and graveyard (now
washed away by the sea).
Close Historic Association
Orrisdale House first came into possession of the Crellin family in the mid to late
eighteenth century. The Crellins are one of the most distinguished families in the
north of the Island and although some of the family migrated to Ballachurry in
Andreas, the old Orrisdale House remains in Crellin hands to the present day.
There have been many notable members of the Crellin family, including a Deemster, a
Colonel in Command of the Northern Manks Volunteers, a Vicar-General, a Captain of
the Parish and several MHK’s.
Age and Rarity
The oldest part of the present property at least dates from the time when John Frissell
Crellin was northern Deemster (1796-1814), although it could be much older than this,
as the estate dates back to at least the time of the Manorial Roll of 1515.
