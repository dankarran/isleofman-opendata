The Bay Queen Hotel
Port St. Mary
Historical Notes
The West Wing of the Bay Queen Hotel, situated on Port St. Mary’s Promenade, was
designed predominantly in the Art Deco Style, by Alexander J. Davidson R.LB.A., F.S.L,
Chartered Architect of Douglas.
In the 1930’s the owner Mr. W, A. Kelly M.H.K., accompanied by his wife and son, visited
the United States of America to search for ideas for the proposed extension to the existing
Victorian building. Mr Davidson also spent six months on a study tour of the USA and this
obviously influenced his approach to the design of the new wing and this is seen to full
advantage in the design of parts of the interior. The entrance lobby incorporates a
mezzanine floor and two passenger lifts, very innovative at the time, and was fashioned on.
a similar space in the Waldorf Astoria in New York.
The Western extension to the hotel was designed and built at a time of buoyant conditions
in the Isle of Man tourist industry and provided an extra 50 bedrooms. The new extension
was opened in time for the later part of the 1935 season and there followed only three
complete tourist seasons before the outbreak of war. The hotel was requisitioned by the
War Office and after an initial short period when it was used to house German and Austrian
fernale internees, it was used as an Officer Cadet Training Unit during which time the
rather unattractive and inappropriate rectangular building, the NAAFI, was added: this
covered the middle three arches of the original nine larger arched windows on the West
elevation.
Mr. Herbert Moore of Athol Street, Port St. Mary, Sub-Contractor to W. McArd & Son of
Port Erin, was responsible for the joinery, crafting the woodwork to the Reception and the
Mezzanine, in Oak. The terrazzo tiling to the Reception floor is said to have been installed
by Italian craftsman brought in from Italy to do the work. The geometrical design
incorporated into this floor is characteristic of the period and is also reflected in the glazed
ceiling to the main Dining Room, which leads off this space. The Dining Room was built
to seat 400 people: Mrs, M. E. Kelly, who’s late husband was the son of W. A. Kelly and
referred to above, recalls that 300 people were accommodated in the Hotel and it’s annexes
on the Promenade, together with 90 staff which supplied everything daily to the Hotel.
The 1935 extension to the Victorian Hotel was one of few hotels built on the Island
between the wars and is the only one in this distinctive Art Deco Style. Thus the building
represents a unique example of it’s type in the Island context. It is also thought to be the
first instance of a modern Manx Hotel to be constructed in cavity brickwork, rather than
random rubble solid stone walls which, until then had been the usual approach.

Architecture
Situated on the Eastern end of the promenade in Port St. Mary, the Bay Queen Hotel stands
out on the skyline as one of the town’s landmark buildings and being located on this
prominent coastal headland, it is clearly visible from both land and sea.
The plan and elevation of the hotel are articulated by the square towers to the North West
and South West comers of the building, a simple projecting bay onto the Promenade and
the addition of the NAAFI canteen facilities to the West elevation during the last war.
The main five storey facade onto the Promenade is expressed with a double height base, or
plinth, defined by a simple projecting string course ovolo moulding, above which two
floors of hotel rooms terminate with a mansard roofed attic storey, into which are inserted
flat roofed dormer windows.
The entrance at ground floor level on the front elevation, is expressed by a projecting bay
finished with a simple shallow pitched pediment. The entrance door is situated in the centre
of a row of five arched double height windows, repeated around the base of the building.
The theme of the semi-circular twin arched window with its central Etruscan column is
reproduced in the fenestration to the three elevations of the twin towers. This distinctive
format is repeated at three levels on the towers and interest is subtly added by a raised
vertical band of render at the quoins of the towers, terminating below attic high level
windows, in a freize emulating the arched head forms of the windows. The attic storey is
delineated by slim horizontally orientated windows, sel in raised rendered bands. The
towers terminate in low pitched, pyramidal slate roofs, supported off deep overhanging
eaves which are formed on stepped corbel brackets. The visual impact of the twin towers is
monumental in approach and together with the detail in low relief, is characteristic of the
European interpretation of the Egyptian Style which is associated with and characterises the
Art Deco approach to architectural design.
The interior of the Bay Queen Hotel retains areas of considerable quality, which in terms of
material finish, are better than the exterior of the hotel. The double height entrance foyer is
richly furnished with Italian terrazzo floor tiling and locally crafted oak detailing in the
balconies, reception desk, screens and staircases. Original copper lights hang from the high,
coved ceilings: copper wall sconces are also still in place and such fittings form an integral
part of the special quality which the property retains.
The Dining Room is naturally lit with a stained glass skylight, very evocative of it’s time.
The base of the wall is decorated with two horizontal reeded rails sited equidistant between
the dado rail and the skirting. Again this approach to detailing characterises the Art Deco
style. Original images have been wall mounted, advocating the many attractions and
activities to be enjoyed in the vicinity of the hotel.

The Bay Queen Hotel makes a major contribution to the Island’s historic built environment,
not only within the local context of Port St. Mary where it is a prominent landmark on the
Promenade, but in the wider context of the Island’s Tourist industry and architectural
development. The presence of the hotel on the Promenade, provides a tangible link with the
town’s historical a sociological development and is to be valued.
The Bay Queen Hotel, Port St. Mary, is judged worthy of entry into the Protected
Buildings Register on the following grounds:-
HISTORIC CONTEXT- In the context of the Isle of Man as a separate entity, the
building deserves special consideration in that it is an outstanding example of local
hotel design for an industry which has and still is, of great significance to the island
as it illustrates an important aspect of the history of the Islands tourist industry.
LANDMARK QUALITY -The 1935 section of the Bay Queen Hotel is a building
which adopts a monumental approach to it’s design, and as such has become a well
known feature in the built landscape of Port St. Mary contributing to the town’s
unique character.
RARITY and AESTHETIC QUALITY - The West Wing of the Hotel constitutes a
unigue example of a building which substantially adopts the Art Deco Style of
Architecture retaining much of it’s original detailing; both externally and
internally. As such, the building is judged to be worthy of protection.

Note
Art Deco was a style fashionable in the 1920's and early 1930’s, taking it’s name from the Exposition des
Arts Decoraty et Industtels Modernes in Paris m 1925 It's sources derive from the rectilinear forms which
were exploied as a reaction to the curvilinear forms associated with Art Nouveau. It is associated with
stepped forms, the chevron, bright primary colors and rich matenals. It was strongly influenced by Ancient
Egyptian design prompted by the discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb m 1922, and incorporated not only
Egyptran elements, but forms and motifs that were associated with what Europeans thought Egyptian
design. included, notably the stepped corbel and the stepped gable, (both of which suggest the pyramidal
form)
