History of Mullinargher Farm, Santon
Information taken from manuscript accession number: 9983 - Robert Moore’s account
book and two of Thomas. C. Kinnish’s diaries.
Robert Moore’s account book dates back to June 17" 1876. It gives details of all the
wages that were paid to workers on the farm in Ballachurry, Kirk Santon as well as all
personal expenses. However, it was not until March 1881 that the account book was first
used,
e John Kewley’s wage for the year 1881 was £15. This was spent on a variety of things
such as Ascension Day, Castletown Flower Show and cloth.
e Food mainly consisted of barley, flour and general crops that were made into a meal.
e George Quayle’s wage for the year 1880-1881 was £7 this was spent on new shoes,
debts, travel to Castletown, a pair of drawers and various fairs in Castletown ~ the
cattle show, concert, regatta etc.
e John Caley’s wages for the year 1881 was £11. 15s 0d
e Phillip Quirk’s wages for 1883 was £15.10s. Again this was used to pay for travel
expenses and to buy cloth.
e Mary Shimmin was also a worker on the farm and money was also given to her
mother for making dresses, stockings, slippers and to cover travel expenses to
Douglas.
e The account book also gave details of profit gained by the family from selling crops
such as tumips, pork, coal etc or perhaps even the carcase of sheep. For example, 19
lambs were sold 1o J. Dickinson for 36 shillings each. Hay was also often sold to
many villages as well as Douglas Town Commissioners (1885/6).
® Robert Moore also includes many handwritten “remedies” within his account book,
most of which have a direct link with agriculture such as the page entitled “Cabbages
and Caterpillars, which suggests sowing hemp among the cabbage. Carbonate of
soda mixed with buttermilk was also recommended io cure griping in horses.
Remedies/recipes were also given for sticky fly paper, sore shoulders on horses, how
to measure cattle for their weight, remedy for bums, hair care, a useful colic drink for
horses and a remedy for perspiring feet!
e 1886 —J. R. Gelling contracts to build new front and Gable in bow (?) house for %
per yard also to state for sum of 6/6 per square and allowed three days labour for
clearing out, removing slates etc.

e Facts are also given about his mother’s family. Her great aunt came from
Ballavarvan (?) and was wife to her great uncle by marriage given by Parson Gell. He
was curate for Vicar General Cubbon until he died and then went to St. John’s on K.
K Lonan and K. Bride. Parson Gale had a sister interned in K. Lonan Churchyard.
° Religion played an important role in everyday life and included within the accounts
book were handwritten extracts from the Bible. Church was also attended every
Sunday, further details of which were given in the Diary of Thomas. C. Kinnish.
e A poem in also included in honour of his mother’s death on May 29" 1892. However
the poem was not written until gh July of the same year.
e Copy 1893 — Govt. Inspectors Report of Santon National School. Said to be
creditable, handwriting excellent, arithmetic good, however reading lacks
comprehension and intelligence, spelling is fair, arithmetic is “not strong”, geography
is good, English is fair and needle work and singing deserve praise.
@ A rough sketch is given of a plan for the outhouse (please see photocopy.) The
measurements were 12ft square, which would hold 2 cows and trap, 2 slate stables etc
(see photocopy) and a partition wall was also built to divide cow house and trap from
stable.
@ Newspaper report glued into accounts book entitled “Nature and Science” with
reference to obesity. According to this report there are two types of obesity the first
of which is “pale and flaccidly fat” and these people are likely to perspire easily, and
are prone to asthma. The second type of obesity is said to be “ruddy and blood
making” and these people are stronger and a far healthier. The remedy suggested was
to halve your food intake.

History of Mullinargher Farm, Santon (continued.)
Information taken from the diary of Thomas C. Kinnish (September 9 1879 - September
29" 1880).
Work on the Farm
Manual labour on the farm was difficult, with long hard hours often beginning at
3.30am on Market Day. A variety of crops were grown including oat, wheat, barley,
turnips, carrots, and potatoes etc which meant that these all had to be sown, ploughed and
cared for in order to produce quality crops. There were at least seven fields surrounding
the farm including Longfield, the Big gorse field, Cronkrenny, Ashfield, Oakfield, the
Quarryfield and the Claddagh. Different crops were in each field, which meant a vast
area had to be farmed and with few people and no moderm-day machinery, it was
tiresome work. All the family helped run the farm, and the mother and father, who would
travel by train, often attended market day in Douglas. Various other farming duties also
had to be dealt with such as the thatching of roofs, hedge falling and making stands for
stronger reaper knives.
The animals on the farm also had to be cared for, such as the cows and horses.
The cows were regularly bulled and on 28" October 1882 a heifer calved at 2pm.
Travel to various places on the Island was common in order to sell crops or to
buy materials such as lime and coal. The lime was bought from Jefferson’s Kiln’s and
the coal was from Castletown, and with a cart being the only means of transport it meant
travelling could take up the whole day. Travelling by train however, was becoming
increasingly popular and with Santon Station being relatively nearby il was much easier
than travelling by cart. Travelling by boat across to Liverpool was also popular, and the
Mullinargher family had many visits from their family in Liverpool (Cousin was D. I.
Kinnish). The regular trading of turnips with E. Smith of Anfield, Liverpool was also
apparent. The boat that was most probably used was the Ben My Chree (Steamer).

Leisure activities etc.
Religion was an integral part of everyday life. This is particularly evident throughout the
diary, as a brief summary of farm labour would be given followed by a biblical quote.
The importance of the Bible and Christianity itself, can be seen when Thomas C. Kinnish
made a tule for himself on 20" November, saying that he would write an extract from the
Holy Bible in each diary entry. These become increasingly detailed often taking up more
than half of the account written in the diary. Regular attendance to St. Mark’s church on
a Sunday (Minister ~ Mr. T. Teare) was of paramount importance and Thomas Kinnish’s
involvement within the church can be seen through the sermons he would give to various
churches around the Island, including Peel. Many missionary meetings were also
regularly attended such as the Church Missionary Society meeting on November 5",
Music was also a popular pastime, seen through his purchase of a music book on
Mon 15" Dec 1879, This can also be seen through Thomas Kinnish’s involvement
within the Rotary Club. Rotary Club Day was on the 21% July and Thomas joined a
muster of around 700 or 800 people who were accompanied by four bands of music
which seemingly marched from St. James’ Hall to St. George’s Church for a service, after

which the men paraded the town and promenade were bands were played, and continued
up Victoria Street. A collection was taken during the day for the Industrial Home for
Destitute Children.
Agricultural shows such as the Northern Agricultural show in Kirby were also
well attended and £120 was collected at the gates. However, these weren’t always so
popular and earlier in the year (Nov 12") Thomas admitted to attending the worst fair
he’d ever seen! Thomas Kinnish also attended Michaelmas fair on the 11" Oct 1882,
where he hired J. Cubbon for £10.
Fishing and shooting were also popular and successful ways of gaining more
produce to sell on market day, such as trout, lobster, geese and rabbit.
The weather had a vital impact on the farming community, and a daily account of
the weather is always given within each diary entry. Weather conditions are not only
vital in order to grow crops but bad whether can cause bad structural damage on the farm
itself, This can be seen on 29" January 1883 when bad whether overtumed stacks and
blew thousands of slates off houses.
Finances were seemingly well looked after on the farm, seen through the detailed
accounts book and the shares which the mother and father had in The Manx Bank Ltd
(£5).
