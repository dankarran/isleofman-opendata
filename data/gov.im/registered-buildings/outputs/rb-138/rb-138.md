KIRK CHRIST PAROCHYAL CHURCH
LEZAYRE.
History.
Perhaps the most comprehensive writings on the church are ta be
found in "Phe Annals of Kirk Christ" written in 1954 by Reverend
Canon R.D. Kermode M.A., the daughter of whom is stiil aiive
and well and a source of much information about the parish.
The Annals mention:
"Of the Old Church hardly a vestige remains. It
was Situated in the eastern part of the Churchyard,
on a portion of Land levelled out on the hillside.
This ground is now filled with graves. There
is very little known about it before the eighteenth
century.
The oldest reference is the Visitation of
Bishop Foster in 1634. Unfortunately the document
1s in a very fragmentary condition.
Moore’ states that in the seventeenth century
"the general condition of the churches seems
to have been very bad, there being entries
in the records which tend to show that they
were little better than barns, and in a miserable
state of repair". From time to time efforts
were made by the authorities to prevent the
fabrics falling into decay. In 1657 the Council
and the Keys issued an enactment that "the
assessment for the reparacon of the Churches
in this Isle...ought to be made on the ffarmers
of the quarterlands according to their respective
rents and upon inhabitants according to their
abilities, all intack houlders, cottage houlders,
Tradesmen and Townes inhabitants and this
to bee made and levied by the Church-wardens
for the tyme being in each yeare".
In 1683 it is recorded that there is "a great
indecency and disorder in all or most of the
parishn churches for want of sufficient and
commendable seats”. The holders were therefore
ordered to take “speedy course for the repairinge
and making up of their respective seats and
pewes, in some nandsome and orderly manner
according to their severall abilities".
The condition of the church of Lezayre seems
to have been as bad as all the rest. By the
end of the century
it had become ruinous,
for in 1704 it was rebuilt on the ancient
site by Bishop Wilson. Over the main door
a stone was erected with the following inscription:
To the honour of the sacred Trinity. This
Church wes rebuilt A.D. 1704, The Right Rev.
Dr. Ts Wilson, the Bishop, Mr. Rob. Parr,
the Vicar Generail, Minister; James Christian,
John Curghey and Edmund Corlett and Robert
Curghey, Church-wardens.

A public meeting of the principal landowners
was held in the Parish Church on December
30th, 1829 “for the purpose of taking into
consideration the propriety and necessity
of erecting a new church...upon such plan
as may be agreed upon - Resolved that the
Lord Bishop be solicited to issue his Authority
to summon a jury of four competent men to
view and report the state and condition of
the said church. And we, whose names are hereunder
subscribed, respectfully request his Lordship
to issue such authority to the proper officer
accordingly."
The Bishop issued the Authority on the next
day. The report came down that the existing
church was "in an insuffictent state". On
January 18th the Bishop ordered that the
Verdict and accompanying documents should
be recorded ub his Registry. The Bill of the
jury was £1 10s. Od. with 2s. 6d. paid to
the Clerk for drawing up the report etc.
The land on which an Assessment could be levied
being reckoned as equivalent to 74% Quarteriands;
the sum raised was £747 10s. Od. Later a further
assessment of £22 Os. Od. was made. Presumabiy
the balance was expended on pulling the old
Church down and building a wall around a new
one. IT have not been able to ascertain what
amount the Government paid for the Chancel,
nor what the Bishoo gave out of the large
sum which he collected for church building.
Soon after the Church was built a galley was
required - not because there was not sufficient
room for the congregation, but because there
Was not space to supply 75 Quarterland seats
and a few free ones in addition. But there
was no money available, so they adopted a
strange expedient. They sold plots of land
in the Chancel on which the purchasers would
erect private pews, in addition to their Quarterland
seats. Receipts for some of the payments are
still preserved in the Diocesan Registry.
About a dozen pew spaces were thus sold. In
every case the families have died cut or moved
away and the pews were removed at the alterations
made in 1927 and 1938. In the case of Michael
Cowley the right to the pew was solid along
with the house. Elm Bank is now the property
of the Vicar and Wardens under the will of
the late Clerk - Mr. W.K. Lace.
Michael Cowley was gquiity of a great act of
vandalism. Before this time the village cross
stood on a vacant piece of ground near to
the churchyard gate. It was the custom for
funeral parties to march around it before
entering the churchyard. The old Lezayre Fair
was held near it. Cowley bought the adjoining
land, and then claimed that the site of the

cross was included in the purchase. There
was a protracted lawsuit which finally went
before the House of Keys in 1834. Cowley won
his case. That was the end of the cross. It
was broken up, the head was rescued and is
preserved in the church porch along with many
other cross heads preserved from the churchyard.
On July iith, 1835, the Vicar, Wardens and
parishoners asked the Bishop to consecrate
the Church. The Act of Consecration is dated
July i4tn. The pews were allotted in 1838.
So the new church was built, but the committee
does not seem to have taken much care over
1ts equipment etc. The Visitation of 1835
Stated that the fabric, furniture are good,
both Bibles new, English Prayer Books, one
tolerable and one very bad, Linen, Napkins
etc extremely bad ~ and that in the year that
the church was consecrated.
The Church Today.
It is visible from the main Ramsey to Sulby Road, lLandmarked
by the Church's own War Memorial, standing at the roadside.
It is surrounded by numerous trees which make the approach
to the Church very pleasurable. The Church itself is
in good repair, the roof is currently undergoing replacement.
The interior is perhaps more impressive still with various
holy inscriptions written in Manx on the walls and plaques
and wall mountings adorning the walls. One such plague,
made from brass bears the inscription:
"fo the glory of God and in memory of the
Following descendants of Gillocrist ad 1176
in this Parish and of Ewanrigg in Cumberland
from whom through more than 21 generations,
Miintown passed in the direct male line AD
1380 ~ 1904..."
The List begins with John MacCrystyn 1380, Justiciaruis
Insulae 1408 and ends with Edward Alan Christian 1879
~ 1918 who died at Milntown i7th February, 1918, erected
by Vio. Widow of William Bell Christian AD 1922. Amongst
these is "John Christian 1602 - 1650 Deemster, imprisoned
and his brother William Christian of Ronaldsway and Langness,
known to his sountrymen as Iliam Dhone, 1608 - 1662 Governor
and Great Patriot, shot at Hango Hill.”
There are hand-sewn hassocks
abt the foot of every pew
and at the back of the Church on the right hand side
is a wall plaque bearing the names of all the Parish
vicars, from Michael in 1408, to C.J. Fleetney in 1986.
the newest vicar was installed on 2nd July, 1991. This
plague was presented by Miss Ruth and Major John Shaw
in memory of their sister Elizabeth in 1973.
Next to the altar, at the head of the building, to the
left sits the organ until 1990 cared for by Cecil Clutton
CBE who was partly responsible for building the organ
for St. Paul's Cathedral. Also Known as an eminent historic

car and motorbike collector and horologist. His memorial
service was, fittingly, held at St. Paul's.
There are various impressive stained glass windows around
the Church. One erected in 1853 in the Chancel in memory
of Deemster John Christian of Milintown who died in 1852
and Susanna, his wife who died in 1853.
In 1884 a window of more than ordinary interest was placed
in the north side of the Church. The inscription states
that it was erected by Daniel Cottier, Glasspainter in
memory of his father, Daniel Cottier who died in 1847;
and of his grandfather, Daniel Cottier who died in 1803.
The window contains two lancets, each containing four
panels surrounded by a conventional pattern. The panels
represent - reading from top to bottom - on the west,
Industria, Temperantia, Caritas, Veritas; on the east
Modestia, Patientia, Fortitudo, Castitas. The colouring
is rich and good. Daniel Cottier belonged to a Lezayre
family (his grandfather was buried here in 1803, July
12th). He is the only Manxman, as far as it is known,
who attained eminence as a glasspainter.
In the porch, before entering the church proper sit 11
pieces of cross slabs, dating from the 8th to the 12th
century, some found in 1928 in the cemetery surrounding
an early and long-forgotten Celtic church at Cronk yn
How Balleigh.
