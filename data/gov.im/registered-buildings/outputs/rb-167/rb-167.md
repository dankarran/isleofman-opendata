THE DOUGLAS COURT HOUSE
INCLUDING No 13 ATHOL STREET
This building is probably the most notable work of the local architect John Robinson
who contributed a wealth of fine buildings to the Island's architectural stock. His father
{also John Robinson) came to the Isle of Man 1793 to work on the new Nunnery Mill:
having decided to stay, he married Jane Cannell and they went on to have eight children,
of which John and his brother Henry, were two.
The John Robinson whose work became so revered, worked with his father, but there is
no evidence of him having any formal architectural training. Although John Robinson
may be termed an "amateur" architect, his designs served to lift the town of Douglas
almost out of the "dark ages" giving us such fine compositions as are seen in Clarence
Terrace, the Esplanade and the Bank of Mona (now Government Offices, Bucks Road).
Robinson was also responsible for the design of Prospect Terrace and the buildings
which face it across Woodbourne Road, including the Rosemount Hotel.
The first signs of town planning were seen in the layout of streets and terraces in the
locality of Mount Havelock and Bucks Road.
John*s brother had for some time worked in London on such notable buildings as
Hampton Court, Apsley House (for the Duke of Wellington) and on the reknowned Bank
of England. When John was commissioned to design the new Meeting Rooms and
Concert Hall for the Independant Order of Oddfellows, it was brother Henry who
undertook the responsibility of building the structure.
The Hall was, in its time, said to be the largest room in the Island, capable of
accommodating 400 persons at dinner, with a gallery above providing seating for a
further 150. The lower levels held Jarge kitchens with shops and offices around the
perimeter, which could be let to tenants and so provide a useful source of income.
The building did not receive its fine "cloak" of elegantly detailed lime stucco until 1850:
by this time the building had changed in use to The Prince of Wales Theatre.
The Isle of Man Government acquired the use of the property in 1860, when it was used
as the Rolls Office, as a meeting place for the Legislature and as a Court House, in
which use it has remained until very recently.
Number 13 Athol Street is included in this Registration: this building has historically
been linked to and identified as being part of the main Court House and its Athol Street
facade has been modelled to respond to the rich Georgian architecture of the main
building itself.
Designed in the Neo-Classical style, the Court House retains some of its fine
architectural features on a scale which is imposing and yet it has a fine intricacy of
detailing, as seen in the capitals of the four Corinthian columns of the portico.
The Athol Street and Church Street elevations combine to provide us with one of the
finest examples of Georgian architecture in the Island and it is this aspect of the building
which undoubtedly provides the focus of Registration. The rear elevation is very plain
and is in fact, the face of the building which remains, following demolition some time
ago, of small lean-to shops.

The skill with which Robinson "turns the corner" shows the elegance and ease of the
designer in handling what is always a very telling aspect of an architects ability.
The building has undergone changes during its life having lost parapet ballustrading and
other features, added to which the internal re-modelling for use as the main Police
Station, has resulted in the original concept of the interior having been, to a great extent,
lost along the way.
The present building does provide us with a unique civic landmark
and is deemed to be worthy of entry into the Register of Protected Buildings on the
following grounds:-
1) The Aesthetic Quality of the building, in particular, the external stucco werk to
be found on the Athol Street and Church Street elevations;
2) The unique role which the building has played in the Socialogical and Historical
development of the Island, particularly by virtue of its use as the central Court
House for the Island and its traditional connections with the Judicial system.
3) The building is among the most notable works of one of the Island*s finest
Architects, John Robinson 1798 - 1880.
