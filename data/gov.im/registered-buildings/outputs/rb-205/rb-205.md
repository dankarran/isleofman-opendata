Tower of Refuge
St Mary’s Rock, Douglas Bay
The Tower of Refuge, positioned as it is, is a prominent landmark and could almost be
considered a national monument. Passengers arriving on the Isle of Man Steam Packet
boats, even before docking, as soon as they pass by feel that they have arrived safely at the
Isle of Man.
The Tower was constructed in 1832. A bronze plaque on the Tower dated May 1932 states
“in grateful memory of Sir William Hillary, the founder of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution who 100 years ago erected this Tower on the St Marys Rock as a warning to all
sea craft and as a refuge in case of shipwreck”.
The Architect was John Welch of the firm Hansom & Welch. Their work is well
documented throughout the Island and includes the Smelt Memorial in Castletown and
buildings at King William’s College.
Following its construction, the rock on which it was built was conveyed to Sir William
Hillary to be held by him for life
as president of the Isle of Man district of the Royal
National Lifeboat Institution and to all future presidents in trust.
The Tower is constructed largely of local limestone, a particular feature being that the
individual stones are drilled and copper rods have been inserted as dowel pins to securely
locate one stone on another.
The structure is triangular in plan with three turrets/towers at the corners. A large tower is
at the apex with two smaller towers at each end of the baseline. The large tower has been
positioned to face the prevailing winds and seas and the base, which provides the access,
faces Douglas Bay and is more protected. In addition, the rounding of the corners reduces
the exposure of the building to the ravages of the sea. An open deck which is accessed
from the rocks by protected stairs is set above the high water mark. In addition there is a
Square staircase tower which serves the larger round tower and allows for signalling and
access to the interior.
Simple and robust in form, the architectural detailing is reminiscent of a mediaeval keep
with corbelled castellated battlements and narrow slit windows. The building rises from the
rocks on battered stonework which reduces the impact of the waves at sea level. The walls
then rise vertically to different heights to be capped by the battlements as noted.
