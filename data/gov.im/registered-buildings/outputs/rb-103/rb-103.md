the request

Dear Mr Watson
re: Registered Building, Bridge Street, Castletown
Following your telephone call on 8 November 1989 I met Patrick Simpson at
Castletown the following day to inspect damage to the above building caused by
the contractor's operations on the adjoining site. My comments are as follows.
1, The registered building is a two-storey cottage with a slate roof, a rendered
front wall and a natural stone gable wall.
The front wall has a prominent outward bulge for more tham half it's length.
It is at present supported temporarily with a timber shore.
The stone gable wall is substantial, appears to t structurally sound, and
will be completely covered by the adjoining wall being built against it.
2. The end of the stone gable wall, perhaps an 18" length, has been demolished
for it's full height.
it 1s clear that the gable wall was not bonded to the front wall; there is a
vertical end to the front wall, revealed by the accidental demolition, that
has not been affected to any great extent by the accidental damage to the
gable end.
3. The outward bulge on the front wall is pronounced. It is not of recent
origin. Although there is some cracking in the external rendering it does
not appear to have been caused or worsened significantly by the accident.
The junction with the gable, though unbonded, probably provided a degree of
stiffening to the front wall, and any proposal for remedial work must include
the provision of adequate structural support.

+495 Weer Street London SE1 ILO 01-403 0889

J Malcolm Watson Esq 2
Without a full internal inspection of the first floor and roof junctions
with the front wall it is not possible to reach firm conclusions about the
scope of remedial work necessary, but it should avoid if possible the
demolition and re-building of the wall. It's shape, it's texture, the
out-of-square window and door openings are important aspects of the character
of this old cottage. It would be possible, though expensive, to rebuild the
wall, following a detailed measured survey, with it's existing profile and
misalignments. However, it's retention with added structural support should
be the objective.
I have not seen drawings of the adjoining development, and do not know what
the gable wall end looked like before it was demolished.
It should, in my opinion, either be re-built as it appeared before the
accident, or the front wall should be extended across it's end, with a
proper structural connection, to a junction with the new building.
I would recommend an examination of the interior of the building, particularly
of the roof and first floor structure,
It might then be necessary to ask for an engineer's report.
6. Any remedial work should be fully specified and it's implementation carefully
supervised.
I will forward, in a few days, some annotated prints of the coloured photographs
I took.
I hope this short response will be helpful to you at this stage. Please let me
know if you wish me to provide any further assistance or advice.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Hunt,
Registered Building No. 103, Bridge Street, Castletown
I refer to the site visit by Mr. P. Simpson, Planning Enforcement
Officer, on the 24th October, 1989, when you accompanied Mr. Simpson to
assess the damage that had been occasioned to the above building during
the course of the demolition of the building on the site which is the
subject of PA88/1965.
The Department proposes to engage the services of a suitably qualified
structural engineer to assess the damage and to make recommendations a.
to how best put matters right. The resultant recommendations will form
the basis of a repairs notice to be served under the terms of the
Registered Buildings Regulations 1987.
You may wish to engage the services of a suitably qualified person to
advise you in this regard.
In the meantime, I would urge you to take every precaution to ensure
that no further damage occurs to any part of registered building 103
and that satisfactory measures are taken in the short-term to secure
the structural stability of the building.
I would draw your attention to $12 and Schedule 1 of the Town & Country
Planning Act 1961 and, in particular, S12(2)(1) of Schedule 2 referred
to, which deals with offences for demolition or alteration of a
registered building without consent. I trust that we can look forward
to your cooperation in securing the integrity of this building and its
successful repair
Yours faithfully,

The Chief Executive has authorised the employment of a structural
engineer to survey and report on the damage caused to the building. Of
particular importance will be a schedule of work necessary to make the
building sound.
Please approach a suitably qualified structural engineer and negotiate
a fee for this work, which must be given a high priority.
It may be worth approaching Mr. Hunt to persuade him to share the cost

Re: Damage to Registered Building No. 103

In response to a telephone message from the owner of the
above property (Mr. Dermot Hunt, 824165) stating that,
in the course of demolishing the adjoining disused
warehouse (P.A. 88/1965) damage had been occasioned to
the subject building. I visited the site in the company
of Mr. Hunt at 0935 on 24th October, 1989.
The location of the building is shown on the
accompanying map.
Photogtaph I taken from inside the building showing the
full depth of the wall.
Photograph II as I without flash.
Photograph ‘III reverse view to I and II
Photograph IV to VI External views
The damage effected to the building is self evident from
the various photographs. The bow in the front wall which
the contractor has shored up is some 75 mm in amplitude.
It can be seen from the clear vertical lines in
photographs III and IV, in particular that the
registered building was constructed after the warehouse,
merely butting up against it. The implication of this is
that the bowing is due to the demolition work as there
could be very little resistance to bowing caused by
"natural 7AUS2S " due to the inherent structural
Weakness at the junction of the two buildings.

Dear Barry,
5013: Brewery Wharf, Castletown, I.0.M.
As you know we now appear to have agreed on all outstanding Planning matters
related to this development. However, there does remain one small point
which I would like to clarify with you. The registered archway has
two large doors to be reconstructed to match the originals and these are
now being made. As far as the smaller archway, namely the pedestrian
access is concerned I would prefer to use a metal gate with pattern to
match the existing railings rather than a solid door. Do you have any
svrong feelings regarding this and in any event I would like to have your
opinion so that we can resolve this matter.
Perhaps you would contact me early next week or indeed meet me on site
on Wednesday as I shall be there all that day.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Mr. Wilson,
On review: Registered Building No 103 - Castletown Brewery
As previously notified by telephone I write to confirm that unless
specifically requested no member of the Trust's staff will attend the
above Review.
This fs one of the most interesting and important groups of industrial
buildings in the Island. The single reservation of my Trust concerning
this Registration is that it fs restricted to the Cottages, lately used
as offices and a shop, and does not include the fmpressive brewery
premises themselves. The rear range in particular is in excellent
condition and has only undergone minor alterations, it certainly merits
retention.
The concept of re-utilising industrial buildings of all sizes as high-
class domestic accomodation along the lines of such developments as
the Docklands in London and Albert Dock in Liverpool {s now well
established and the Castletown Brewery complex would appear to offer a
guperb opportunity to a sensitive and imaginative Developer here on the
sle of Nan.
I am enclosing some initial research notes by Ms. Yvonne Hayhurst,
Assistant Keeper, which cutline the historical developuent of the site.
Yours sincerely,
S. Harrison

Re: Castletown Brevery Site
Meeting with Mr, Dermott Hunt, Mr, Vannan and Mr. Sinden present.
Mr, Hunt produced a sketch indicating a development for the site
which incorporated about 30 houses and flats in a sympathetic small
scale form. The registered buildings are to be retained.
He is buying the site without planning permission and was looking
for an opinion from the staff, I indicated that the proposals
appeared to be appropriate and looked forward to seeing the details
when available,

To: Secretary, Planning Committee. (for the attention of Members)
From: Architect and Planning Officer.
Castletown Brewery
Meeting with Mr. J.D. Bolton and adviser from Cowley Groves.
Mr. Bolton is interested in developing very high quality apartments
possibly with limited office accommodation on the site in a style
which would tie in sympathetically with Castletown.
I advised him to employ a very good architect to come up with suggestions
we could discuss, but I saw no objection to the land use.
Should his company acquire the site they would like to use a part
of it in the meantime as a laundry to service the Golf Links Hotel.
As the use of the land is already industrial I believe this would
be acceptable.

REGISTERED BUILDING (GENERAL) REGULATIONS 1982
We acknowledge receipt of your notice dated 7th September, 1987 which we
received today regarding the registration of certain properties contained
in the Castletown Brewery site.
We note from your notice that the registration is to be made public on
10th September 1987. Given that assurance in your notice you can imagine
our embarrassment when we were today asked to comment on the registration
by Manx Radio before we had time to read the contents of your notice, never-
mind assess the impact thereof. From our point of view we interpret Manx
Radio as being the public although it does operate under the umbrella of
Government. We should appreciate your comments.
We hereby request a review ofyour committee's decision. on the grounds that
such registration could prejudice a development on the site that would be
beneficial to the community of Castletown. At present discussions are
actively taking place regarding the development of this site.
Please acknowledge receipt of our request for a review.

Dear Sir,
‘The Society for the Preservation of the Manx Countryside are deeply
concerned that the facade, at least,
of the Gastletown Brewery should be
protected; and that the nice little buildings around it, including the
cottages running to Bridge House, which blend so well with Castletown's
unique atmosphere and appearance should be retained.

Manx Museum and National Trust
HISTORICAL BUILDING SEQUENCE OF CASTLETOWN BREWERY SITE,
DOUGLAS STREET, CASTLETOWN.
1824 (TRADE DIRECTORY)
No mention in trade directory of anyone living or owning premises in
Douglas Street. Lieutenant Governor still residing in Castle Rushen
rather than Lorn House and no mention of House or occupants in
Directory. Site therefore probably underdeveloped.
John Quayle, Brewer listed as being at the Parade, Castletown.
1837-1852 (TRADE DIRECTORIES)
Trade directories list John Quayle, Brewer as being at Douglas
Street.
1851 Census lists John Quayle as living at Douglas Quay with his
wife, 5 children and 3 servants and his occupation is given as being
a landed proprietor and brewer employing 8 men. This property might
actually have been on the quay or be the part of the Brewery that
until recently was used as office accommodation. (Marked (5) on the
plan.
1857-1863 (TRADE DIRECTORIES)
Brewery run by Robert Quayle & Co. Brewer and Maltster: (son of John
Quayle).
No mention of Robert Quayle living on Douglas Quay or Street in 1861
census, thereby conforming to general trend in that period for
industrialists to move away from their factories and premises. This
also supports the supposition that the Quayles were living “over the
shop".
At the beginning of Douglas Street in the 1861 census there are
recorded Thomas Christian, Maltster at the Brewery, and his family
including his eldest son who was assistant maltster and next door a
Mr. Cooil who was drayman at the Brewery. There is a strong
likelihood that the Maltster as chief employee was occupying the
Brewery House recently vacated by the new owner after his father's
death and that the drayman lived in the smaller adjacent cottage
now occupied by the wine shop for the Brewery.
1871 (CENSUS)
In the 1871 census the properties are occupied by a new brewer and
drayman so the house and cottage were probably tied accommodation
which accompanied the two jobs. The present office area and

6.
probable Brewer's house has always been an integral part of the
Brewery as can be seen on the map (5). The adjacent cottages though
are structurally distinct although the present wine shop (4) has
probably been linked since at least 1851 and the others may also
have been tied accommodation since they were occupied by labourers
who may have been brewery labourers. Thomas Creetch, labourer 1851
census appears as drayman in 1861. Also the land referred to in
"John Quayle - landed proprietor’ may relate to these houses and
Tand with Quayle renting them to employees and other tradesmen as an
additional source of income. The entire block therefore of Brewery
and cottages may have always comprised a single unit of industrial
and associated workers living accommodation. A detailed search
though of deeds would have to be made before this could be fully
Substantiated and also work done on how the land was partitioned off
and divided into blocks for the Brewery and cottages (1825-1836).
1882 (TRADE DIRECTORY)
Directory lists Brewery as Quayle and Usher of Castle Rushen Brewery
with George Parsons Quayle of Rushen House and Thomas Frederick
Usher of Bay View Villa.
1889-1894 (TRADE DIRECTORIES)
Edward Theordore Sherlock, Brewer and Maltster of Castle Rushen
Brewery which then became Castletown Brewery Co. with Herbert A. Cox
as secretary.
1909 (PHOTOGRAPHS)
Between the 1869 0.S. map and photographs of this date an enclosing
front wall was built from the side of the cottage, which is now the
wine shop to the side of the Brewer's house/offices. The long block
marked (1) on the plan had not yet been extended with a single
storey outshot (marked with dotted line). The entry into the yard
was still a narrow gap between. the Brewers house and Brewery,
(marked (1a)). y;
The gable end property (2) was a blind gable wall with door to right
hand aside and window above.
¢-1910-1930's (PHOTOGRAPHS)
Building altered with outshot/single storey extension to length of
building (1). End of building (1) demolished to widen entrance to
yard, now part wall-part gate. New gable wall of building (1) has
second floor window.
Protuding bays with crenulated tops added to either end of office
block and no windows added to the original three.
Gable end property (2) had Ist floor window bricked up and large
ground floor doors inserted.

10.
ll.
12.
1940's (PHOTOGRAPHS)
Outshot to building (1) is heightened at base of chimney, an
original element of building that was encompassed by extension.
Wall and gate removed and new crenulated wall inserted with arch and
crest above scaffolding against wall and arch so possibly in process
of erection in 1947 when photograph was taken. Ventilating ridge of
roof to buiding (1) altered and heightened.
1950's (PHOTOGRAPHS)
Second chimney erected (still standing) and adjacent warehouse
development. Courtyard altered with watertower inserted in north
end and at some point previously the southern end of enclosed
courtyard was demolished.
Greenhouses at end of row of cottages unroofed.
1960's (PHOTOGRAPHS)
Greenhouses partially demolished and row of cottage(s) (3) set back
from the road are extended to the building line. Chimney in main
brewery complex still standing, since demolished otherwise site as
it is today.
SUMMARY
The site is basically still the original 1820-1830's Quayles Brewery
with possible associated industrial housing for workers.
Alterations consist of the demolition of the original chimney,
erection of second chimney and warehouses to the north of the
Brewery and the addition of crenulated porches and arch to the
facade in imitation of the Castle and as part of the 1920's/1930's
fashion to create Mock Tudor buildings. The late period water tower
is also treated in this: style.
